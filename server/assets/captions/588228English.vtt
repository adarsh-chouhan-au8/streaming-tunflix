00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.719
DAN:
Look, I’m incredibly proud

3
00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:36.138
of my career in the military,
and I did two combat tours,

4
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:38.224
but, uh, I was never
gonna be a career guy.

5
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.309
I found my passion
in the Army Research Lab.

6
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.728
I used my GI Bill to, uh...
to go to Cal State,

7
00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:45.189
and I’m currently teaching
high school biology.

8
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.024
MAN
Okay, Dan. I-I think

9
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.193
Arthur’s still reviewing
the proposal.

10
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.070
That’s great,
but I have some more data,

11
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.072
and I’m nearby,
so I-I want to bring

12
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.366
-a new proposal tonight.
-Let me put you on hold.

13
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.868
-

14
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.039
Muri? Muri!

15
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:04.583
Okay, none of you are my child.

16
00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:05.835
Has anyone seen Muri?

17
00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:07.795
-Coming!
-Grab these. I have a mission.

18
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:09.421
Get those to the kitchen.

19
00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:11.757
-Yes, sir.
-There you are. March.

20
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:13.342
-Great party, Dan.
-Oh, thank you. I appreciate...

21
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.885
-Your place smells amazing.
-Thank you.

22
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.220
SPORTSCASTER:
Things are heating up

23
00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:19.014
in this final match
of the World Cup.

24
00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.850
Hey, Forester.

25
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:23.018
-Sorry, guys. Gonna steal him
for a second. -Hey. Sorry, guys.

26
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:25.855
We are out of Christmas napkins.

27
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.107
Okay, we have
"I’m just here for the booze"

28
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.067
or "Happy 70th birthday."

29
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.278
-Go "Happy 70th."
-Yeah.

30
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.487
Babe, I’m on hold right now.

31
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:34.697
They’re trying
to track down Arthur.

32
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.157
-Right now?
-This is happening right now.

33
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.492
I am gonna punch you

34
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:40.286
in your unfortunately
very handsome face.

35
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.705
This is the call, though.

36
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.331
I’m in the final round.

37
00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:46.041
This is real work
in an actual lab.

38
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.626
It’s my dream.

39
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.545
-Well, Muri’s dream is that
you wa... -MURI: Hee-haw!

40
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:52.298
-...that you watch the game
with her. -Oh, hi.

41
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.424
Hee-haw!

42
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.260
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

43
00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.345
I promise I’ll be back
before the end of the game.

44
00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.513
-Okay?
-All right.

45
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.433
-What’s this?
-Um, that’s...

46
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.978
Your-your dad sent Muri
a Christmas card.

47
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.855
-Can we talk about it tomorrow?
-Hmm.

48
00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:09.565
Babe, we’ll talk about it.

49
00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.233
-Daniel. What?

50
00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:12.610
We don’t have to talk.

51
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.861
He’s just trying to be
a grandpa.

52
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.070
Well, I think he forfeited

53
00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:16.405
the right to meet
his granddaughter

54
00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.782
when he abandoned your husband.

55
00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.326
Hey.

56
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.494
No one’s eating my tuna Santa.

57
00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:25.289
DAN: When I come back,
I’m gonna have a new job,

58
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.042
-and I’m gonna eat all of
your tuna Santa. -

59
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.752
-ARTHUR Hey, Dan.
-EMMY: Bye.

60
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.630
-Arthur. Hey, man.
-ARTHUR: I’m glad you called.

61
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.548
It’s a very competitive
position.

62
00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.301
-Yes, sir.
-And experience is everything.

63
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.303
Well, I have
leadership experience.

64
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.597
I ran combat missions in Iraq.

65
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.307
Does that translate, though?

66
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.267
It sure comes in handy
teaching high school.

67
00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:47.019
Listen.

68
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.647
You’re a great candidate.

69
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.858
The only thing you’re missing is
private sector experience.

70
00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:54.401
MAN:
Which we have to say is

71
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.028
an important part
of what we’re looking for.

72
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.863
No, guys, guys...

73
00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.492
ARTHUR: And that’s why we had
to make a tough choice.

74
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.244
We found someone else.

75
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.081
His background and education--

76
00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.250
he’s just a better fit for us.

77
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.669
MAN:
Sorry, Dan.

78
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.754
ARTHUR:
Good luck.

79
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.428
Yeah.

80
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.522
Of course you’re not the guy.

81
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.941
You are such an idiot.

82
00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.243
Sorry.

83
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.423
-What happened?
-

84
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.342
SPORTSCASTER:
We are live in Qatar

85
00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:02.344
for the first World Cup
held in...

86
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:04.138
You know who Selman Waksman is?

87
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.098
I do.

88
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.897
He discovered the vaccine
for tuberculosis.

89
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.315
Really?

90
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.985
Do you know where he found it?

91
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.319
You tell me.

92
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.488
In the dirt with worms and poop.

93
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.410
SPORTSCASTER: The extreme heat
of our host city

94
00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.537
makes playing in the summertime
all but impossible.

95
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.831
See these people...

96
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.458
playing soccer up there?

97
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.460
They are the best in the world.

98
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.128
Can you believe that?

99
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.089
-I want to be the best.
-Yeah?

100
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.300
Like you are at science.

101
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.095
Like I am at science.

102
00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:48.223
You know what it takes
to be the best.

103
00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:50.100
You got to say to yourself,

104
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.311
"I will do...

105
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.354
I-I will do..."

106
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:56.356
You have to think this.

107
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.609
"...what nobody else
is willing to do."

108
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.196
Yeah. Right?

109
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.739
Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.288
I am meant to do
something special with my life.

111
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.834
Everything’s gonna be okay, Dad.

112
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.094
Thank you, honey.
That’s very sweet of you.

113
00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:28.722
Although I’m pretty sure

114
00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:30.474
it’s supposed to be me
telling you that

115
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.226
and not the other way around.

116
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.602
SPORTSCASTER:
And here’s the corner kick.

117
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.229
This could be it. It’s coming...

118
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.939
And it’s knocked away
by the goalie.

119
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.816
Oh, and it’s a bicycle kick!

120
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.235
-Dad, watch.
-SPORTSCASTER: Wait a minute!

121
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.820
He’s heading down the pitch.

122
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.364
He’s alone,
only one defender behind him.

123
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.407
He’s driving towards it.
It’s unbelievable!

124
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:49.284
Can he do it? Yes, he can!

125
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.249
-

126
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.201
SPORTSCASTER:
50 to 60 armed men and women

127
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.162
standing on the pitch.

128
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.886
-SOLDIER: You’re tapped in.
-HART: Good copy.

129
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.180
It’s okay.

130
00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.812
We are you,

131
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.732
30 years in the future.

132
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.150
It’s okay, sweetie.

133
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.277
HART:
We are fighting a war.

134
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.780
Our enemy is not human.

135
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:11.200
And we are losing.

136
00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:15.537
In 11 months’ time,
all human beings in the future

137
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.081
will be wiped
from the face of the earth

138
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:23.253
unless you help us.

139
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.465
We need you.

140
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:31.678
Our fathers, mothers
and grandparents,

141
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:35.891
we need you to fight beside us

142
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.602
if we stand a chance
at winning this war.

143
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.312
Is this a joke?

144
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.814
You...

145
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:46.026
are our last hope.

146
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.786
12 months ago, we had no idea
how those words

147
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.247
would change everything
about our daily lives.

148
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.207
Immediately, jump facilities

149
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.042
were established
around the globe

150
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.127
to send the world’s military
into the future

151
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.546
and help fight the Whitespikes.

152
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.298
REPORTER 2: The first thousand
soldiers are headed

153
00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:10.300
-28 years into the future.
-WOMAN: Five, four, three...

154
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.136
-We’ll be anxiously awaiting
their return. -...two, one.

155
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.180
Seven days later,
those hopes were dashed

156
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:18.016
as only a handful
of troops survived.

157
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.520
Since only 50% of the military
are qualified to jump,

158
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.730
civilians were needed
to support the war effort,

159
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.691
so the world’s leaders agreed

160
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.485
to institute the first
worldwide draft.

161
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.237
Yesterday, they were civilians.

162
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.781
-We are you.
-But today, they are soldiers.

163
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.158
REPORTER 1: But even with
thousands of civilian soldiers

164
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.160
being sent a week,
the future global population

165
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:41.164
is currently estimated
to be less than 500,000.

166
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.167
And with a draftee survival rate
of less than 20%,

167
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.545
many people are asking:
is it worth it?

168
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.506
The antiwar movement continues
to gain momentum.

169
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.883
There are riots and protests
happening all over the world.

170
00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:54.177
What are we supposed to do?
Just throw up our hands, say,

171
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.804
"Sorry you’re dying"?

172
00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.181
But why should we still
be fighting a war that,

173
00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.850
as far as we’re concerned,
hasn’t even happened?

174
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.351
DODD:
These are our children

175
00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.186
and our grandchildren
that are dying.

176
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.771
We can’t just stand by
and allow them

177
00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:06.565
to be wiped off
the face of the earth.

178
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.483
That’s why we need to draft
more civilians.

179
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:09.860
We need people to fight,

180
00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.862
but we also need people
to solve the problem.

181
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.489
We need to do everything we can
to stop the aliens now.

182
00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:16.700
This may be our last chance
to save the human race.

183
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.660
MURI
Please don’t let them draft you.

184
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.287
Please don’t let them take you.

185
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.289
EMMY: I think you had
a bad dream, honey.

186
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.915
MURI Don’t let them
take you. Please don’t...

187
00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.542
EMMY:
It’s okay. Just breathe.

188
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.127
-It’s okay.
-

189
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.588
Just breathe. Deep breaths.
Right, Daddy?

190
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.007
DAN:
Yeah. In...

191
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.012
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.014
Breathing brings what

193
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:40.682
-into your bloodstream?
-Oxygen.

194
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.309
Oxygen. Very good.

195
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.935
You need oxygen.

196
00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.812
Oxygen feeds your...?

197
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:47.064
Brain.

198
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.940
-To your brain.
-It’s too easy.

199
00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.567
It’s too easy?

200
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.943
All right.

201
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.363
The process of respiration
turns oxygen into what?

202
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.907
Um, carbon dioxide.

203
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.325
What’s carbon dioxide
also called?

204
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.327
CO2.

205
00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:04.831
Maybe you need
a physical challenge.

206
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.792
How about this?

207
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.544
Why don’t you try to squeeze me
as hard as you can?

208
00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:11.129
See if you can hurt me.

209
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:13.465
-Mm.
-

210
00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.717
-

211
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.595
No, no, not hard...
not-not that hard.

212
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.098
If you open your books
to page 47,

213
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.351
talking about photosynthesis
and the magic of chlorophyll.

214
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.769
It’s, uh...

215
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.229
It’s really interesting stuff,
guys. It’s kind of...

216
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.480
They say magic, you know,

217
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.107
it’s not like pulling
a rabbit out of a hat,

218
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.109
but it’s magic,
if you think about it.

219
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.861
The stuff we breathe out,
a tree breathes in?

220
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.073
I know, you guys are speechless

221
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.034
’cause it’s...
it’s so captivating.

222
00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.714
All right, well...

223
00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.258
you want to talk
about something else,

224
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.219
let’s talk about something else.

225
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.513
What gets you excited?

226
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.890
Anybody.
What do you want to talk about?

227
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.687
Anyone?

228
00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.025
Really? Anyone.

229
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.652
Anyone in the class
besides Martin?

230
00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.530
Class, what does Martin want
to talk about?

231
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.323
ALL:
Ancient volcanoes.

232
00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.992
Ancient volcanoes.

233
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.369
Volcanoes are
nature’s fury, guys.

234
00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:27.247
Yes, which you demonstrated
graphically

235
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.748
at the last science fair.

236
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.958
What’s the point?

237
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.586
-What’s the point of what?
-Anything.

238
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.588
School, grades, college--
it’s all bullshit.

239
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:38.049
Yeah. We’ve seen
the new number projections.

240
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.012
We lose, period.

241
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.972
The aliens kill us all.

242
00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.849
Those are numbers
from the year 2051.

243
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.310
-That’s 30 years from now.
-JAYDEN: So?

244
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:53.773
They’re taking thousands
of people every week.

245
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.027
My uncle, Tina’s mom.

246
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.778
They’re gone, man.

247
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.363
DAN:
Listen, guys.

248
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.034
I know it seems pretty bad.

249
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.078
But if there’s one thing
that the world needs right now,

250
00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.331
it’s scientists.

251
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.044
We cannot stop innovating.

252
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.129
That’s how you solve a problem.

253
00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.673
Science is important.

254
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:21.051
So we need to focus up.

255
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.937
PROTESTORS
Not our war! Not our war!

256
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.523
-

257
00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.406
-James Daniel Forester Junior.
-Yes.

258
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.908
You go by James or Jim?

259
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.160
I go by Dan, middle name.

260
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.912
-Birth certificate, passport?
-Yeah.

261
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.705
Uh, the...
it should be in there.

262
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.415
Uh, as-as well as
my employment contract.

263
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.667
Can you have a seat, please?

264
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.752
-Just, uh, over there.
-Sure.

265
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.254
Thank you.

266
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.547
Remove your shirt, please.

267
00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.881
-Remove my shirt?
-Mm.

268
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:02.133
Hey, what is this for?

269
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.804
It’s just a test.

270
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.692
Little extra tight, probably,
but that’s fine.

271
00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:21.528
Oh, a seat belt. Okay.

272
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.071
Oh, is it a driving test?

273
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.739
-OFFICER: It is not.

274
00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.242
No? You don’t have jokes
in the future?

275
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.494
Do you have any children,
Mr. Forester?

276
00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:30.912
-Look up.
-I have a daughter.

277
00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:33.039
I don’t see
her birth certificate.

278
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.332
-OFFICER 2: It’s not there?
-No.

279
00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:35.834
You... I’m not... didn’t...

280
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.460
I didn’t know you needed
her birth certificate.

281
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.296
It’s not required.
However, if you are

282
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.964
-to die in action...
-SAM: Arms straight.

283
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.258
...your dependents will receive
a pretax payment of $1 million.

284
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.302
I’d assume you’d want us

285
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.053
to verify exactly
who your family is.

286
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.179
Yeah. Well, hold on
a second here.

287
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.348
You’re gonna feel
a cold sensation.

288
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.851
What is this test?
What are you testing?

289
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.186
-

290
00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.027
What are you whispering?

291
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.157
Mr. Forester...

292
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.200
you’ve been elevated
to Active-2 status.

293
00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:10.535
What?

294
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:13.121
You meet all requirements
for conscription.

295
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.998
Wh-What... what are the
requirements for conscription?

296
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.416
A pulse?

297
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.630
It says, at 11:23 Eastern Time,

298
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.549
October 13, 2030,

299
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:26.301
you’ll be pronounced dead.

300
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:32.474
It-it says that I die
in seven years?

301
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.518
-Bite down.
-How do I die?

302
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.854
-We can’t share that
information, sir. -But you know?

303
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.189
You’ll really want
to bite down on this

304
00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.523
if you want to keep
from severing your tongue.

305
00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.816
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
One more, one more...

306
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.818
Can you please comply
and bite down, sir?

307
00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.112
Get your hand out of my face,
or I’ll bite your finger off.

308
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.823
-Hold on a second.

309
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.659
Can we just slow this down
for just a second?

310
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.036
-H-Hold on, hold on, hold on.
-

311
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.704
Can we just slow down
one second? I...

312
00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.417
-

313
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.519
This device facilitates your
jump to and from the future war.

314
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.729
It is synched
to your unique biosignature

315
00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.565
and can only be removed when
your tour of duty is complete.

316
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.402
The Jump-band allows us
to track you anywhere on Earth.

317
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.531
Any attempt to evade the draft
or tamper with the device

318
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.741
will result in your imprisonment

319
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.452
or your spouse
or dependent of legal age

320
00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.204
taking your place.

321
00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.832
You have 24 hours to get
your personal affairs in order

322
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.750
and report for basic training.

323
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.586
Do you have any questions?

324
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.217
You’re free to go.

325
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.150
I see you were a squad leader
in the Army Special Ops Command?

326
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.193
In Iraq?

327
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.070
Yeah, 15 years ago.

328
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.450
Thank you for your service.

329
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.368
Again.

330
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.541
EMMY: Who wants to tell me
what they remember?

331
00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.211
About your seven days.

332
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.297
Anyone?

333
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.553
Terry.

334
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.932
You want to tell us anything
you remember?

335
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.768
The clicking.

336
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.940
God, I still can’t get the sound
out of my head.

337
00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:49.527
One starts it, and then
the rest just chime in.

338
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:53.281
That’s when you realize...

339
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.033
they’re never gonna stop.

340
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.078
Not until we’re all dead.

341
00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.550
EMMY: Do you know how many
of these guys come back?

342
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.469
30%-- 30% of draftees return.

343
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.346
I talk to them every day,
and they suffer

344
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.056
so much post-trauma
they can barely talk.

345
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.642
I mean, I-I can see why
you don’t work

346
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.851
in the recruiting department.

347
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.561
We’re gonna run.

348
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.813
Come here.

349
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.231
We’re gonna run.

350
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.482
This is what we’re doing.

351
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.108
You, me and Muri,
we have to run.

352
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.110
We have 24 hours. I don’t know
how to run from the government.

353
00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:32.737
You know someone who does.

354
00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.907
No.

355
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.784
We have to. Dan.

356
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.661
I’m not asking him
for a goddamn thing.

357
00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.079
Do not ask for yourself.

358
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.873
Ask for me. Ask for me, Dan.

359
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.585
Ask for Muri.

360
00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.651
Hello?

361
00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.159
What, are you gonna shoot me?

362
00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.370
I didn’t recognize you.

363
00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:25.832
Must’ve been that metrosexual
scruffle you got there.

364
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.959
I mean, grow a beard or don’t.

365
00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.544
Oh, it’s my beard?

366
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.212
That’s the reason
you don’t recognize me?

367
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.884
-You got a new accessory, huh?
-You, too.

368
00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.677
Desert Eagle .50 cal.

369
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.095
That’s cool.

370
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.014
Yeah, it does the job.

371
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.436
The job of convincing the world
you have a small dick?

372
00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.606
-Oh, what’s this?
-You like that?

373
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.941
That’s like the big-boy version
of that windup toy

374
00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.651
-you drove in.
-That yours?

375
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:56.946
Yep. Got a Bullitt Mustang
parked around back, too.

376
00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.407
Before your time, I guess.

377
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.409
Let me see it.

378
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.956
C-Series.

379
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.875
Second generation.

380
00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:13.004
That’s sensor-calibrated
to your pulse.

381
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:18.885
Fortunately...

382
00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.724
...you came to the only guy for
whom this is a piece of cake.

383
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.226
I wish you wouldn’t drink
while you do this.

384
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.771
I wish Stevie Nicks would
show up in her birthday suit

385
00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.315
with a jar of pickles
and a bottle of baby oil.

386
00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:35.568
What?

387
00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.570
Yeah, don’t-don’t overthink it.

388
00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.740
So, what made you come to me?
I get a good Yelp review?

389
00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.785
Come on.
I know what you do here.

390
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.536
You have a master’s degree
in engineering

391
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.538
and a general disdain
for the U.S. government,

392
00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.832
not to mention
no visible means of income.

393
00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.250
What do you mean?

394
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.002
I fix planes for this rich guy.

395
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.213
He’s got a C-130 out there.

396
00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.298
Yeah, I’m sure that’s
how you can afford a Jeep

397
00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.884
and that Desert Eagle,
high roller.

398
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.395
Are you checking to see
if I’m wearing a wire?

399
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.021
Yeah.
The thought occurred to me.

400
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.523
Oh.

401
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.400
You come here, surprise visit,

402
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.069
talking about my distrust
of the federal government

403
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.696
and my "no visible means
of income."

404
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.197
Yeah, that sounds
like entrapment.

405
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.615
Is that entrapment?

406
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.492
Is that what that sounds like,
Perry Mason?

407
00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.370
Is that ’cause you binge-watch
The Sopranos in your trailer?

408
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.205
You think I’m gonna
get out of the draft

409
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.457
if I give the government you?

410
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.255
There’s gonna be-- some Feds are
gonna come out of your Jeep.

411
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.382
Did you catch that, guys?

412
00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:41.175
Send in Stevie Nicks.

413
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.636
Why else would you come here?
Huh?

414
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.847
You never wanted my help
a day in your life.

415
00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.184
What did you just say to me?

416
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.563
There were years...

417
00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.857
decades...

418
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.984
That was all
we wanted from you,

419
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.819
was a little bit of help.

420
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:09.537
I could’ve used help...

421
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.330
burying your wife.

422
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.334
Let me tell you something.

423
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:20.923
You have no idea what went on
between your mother and me.

424
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.302
When I got back from Nam,

425
00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.095
I was in a very...

426
00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.348
...dark place.

427
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.643
And I...

428
00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:35.980
I couldn’t find a way out.

429
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:41.194
I couldn’t get away
from my anger and my violence.

430
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.322
I couldn’t control myself.

431
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.699
I couldn’t even
recognize myself.

432
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.666
dangerous.

433
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.628
You’ve been mad at me
your whole life

434
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.379
’cause I left you,

435
00:23:00.463 --> 00:23:02.381
but I’m telling you,

436
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:06.135
it would’ve been worse
for you and your mom

437
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:07.887
if I’d have stayed.

438
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.305
No.

439
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.682
You didn’t leave for us.

440
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:18.106
You quit,
because you’re a coward.

441
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.651
And you still are.

442
00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:24.487
Stop sending Christmas cards
to my house.

443
00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.990
You’re never gonna know Muri.

444
00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:31.160
You don’t get a second chance.

445
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.220
EMMY: ...allowed to take $400
out at once from the ATM,

446
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:53.015
but if we get out of town...

447
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.559
What? Hi.

448
00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:56.018
You okay?

449
00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:06.904
I don’t know what’s gonna
happen to me if I go,

450
00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:09.907
but you and I both know
what will happen to all of us

451
00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:11.492
if I stay.

452
00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:13.703
We’ll figure it out together.

453
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:15.621
I know how to do this.

454
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:18.249
It’s seven days. I’ll survive.

455
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:19.750
I’m a pretty tough guy.

456
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:22.837
You’re tough? The man who cries
through every cold?

457
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.964
Yeah.

458
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.884
You have to tell her.

459
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:39.520
What you doing?

460
00:24:39.604 --> 00:24:42.023
Looking for vaccines.

461
00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:44.192
Oh. You find any?

462
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:46.277
Not really.

463
00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:49.739
Digging’s hard.

464
00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.532
Oh, see, it’s about, uh...

465
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:53.910
You’re doing the...
It’s right what you’re doing

466
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.037
with your foot--
you got to give it the weight--

467
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.206
but then you got to use...

468
00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.874
What’s this?

469
00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:01.584
-Leverage.
-Leverage.

470
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.920
DAN:
Son of a bitch.

471
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:06.672
-You did that.
-Oh, hey. Shit.

472
00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:09.425
That’s supposed to be buried
deeper than that.

473
00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.638
I’ll give you ten dollars
if you tell your mom

474
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:15.223
that you cut that cable, not me.

475
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.018
-20.
-20?

476
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.561
All right.

477
00:25:20.645 --> 00:25:22.021
Fist-bump on it.

478
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.689
There you go.

479
00:25:28.653 --> 00:25:30.488
So, uh...

480
00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:34.784
So, listen, Chickpea.

481
00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:37.995
I got to go on a trip.

482
00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.584
Be gone for about a week.

483
00:25:46.087 --> 00:25:48.047
You got drafted.

484
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:53.261
Yeah.

485
00:25:55.263 --> 00:25:56.889
Yeah.

486
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:01.060
Hey, hey, hey.

487
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.645
It’s okay.

488
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.438
Don’t worry.

489
00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:09.318
I want you to know something.

490
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.530
I will be back.

491
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:16.534
Okay.

492
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:21.747
You know I love you, Chickpea.

493
00:26:28.296 --> 00:26:30.423
DODD:
You people...

494
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.091
you all have something
in common.

495
00:26:33.968 --> 00:26:36.971
Whatever your age, occupation,

496
00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:40.057
ethnicity or gender,

497
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:42.310
whatever your background,

498
00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:44.478
you are now heroes.

499
00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:47.398
You answered a call.

500
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.401
It was a cry for help
across time.

501
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:53.612
It’s the voice
of your children...

502
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.241
...and they need you.

503
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:03.497
The sacrifice that you make now
is for them.

504
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.792
For the first time
in human history,

505
00:27:06.876 --> 00:27:08.919
the armed forces
from every nation

506
00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:10.963
are united against one enemy.

507
00:27:11.047 --> 00:27:13.174
DIAZ:
I’m Sergeant Diaz.

508
00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:15.134
I am not your friend.

509
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:17.219
This is.

510
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:19.180
DODD: Seven days from now,
when you are sent

511
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:20.931
-into that war...
-Wrap it around tighter.

512
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:22.558
...you won’t be fighting
for your country.

513
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.060
Open the chamber, please.

514
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.436
You’ll be fighting
for the world.

515
00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:30.149
SOLDIER: I need to see
your weapon’s been cleared.

516
00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:33.486
Throats and abdomens--
that’s what you aim for.

517
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:35.488
On behalf of
the Department of Defense...

518
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:38.699
...and a grateful nation...

519
00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:43.704
...we thank you
for your service.

520
00:27:43.788 --> 00:27:45.456
Lieutenant Hart.

521
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:49.293
Your tour of duty
will be seven days.

522
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:52.963
That’s 168 hours.

523
00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:55.007
At the end of your tour,

524
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:57.802
if the Jump-band attached
to your arm determines

525
00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.804
that you are still
clinically alive...

526
00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:01.347
Are there any doctors?

527
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.808
...you will automatically
be jumped back

528
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:05.434
from wherever you are,

529
00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:08.562
and your tour of duty
will be complete.

530
00:28:08.646 --> 00:28:12.775
What you think you know about
basic training does not apply.

531
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:15.569
You will not march,
crawl or climb.

532
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:18.364
There will be no push-ups,
no pull-ups,

533
00:28:18.447 --> 00:28:20.074
no obstacle courses.

534
00:28:20.157 --> 00:28:22.368
I was kind of
looking forward to that.

535
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:23.702
HART:
You will take

536
00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:26.122
what you are given
and dress as quickly as you can.

537
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.958
Overly ventilated jeans,

538
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:31.293
yoga pant fails,

539
00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:35.089
cargo shorts--
all will be replaced.

540
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:36.549
See, I don’t get
the criteria for,

541
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:37.967
like, what goes and what stays.

542
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.510
Like, they took my shorts,
they left the jacket,

543
00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:41.137
which is clearly, like,
fashion over function.

544
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.264
My man over there is wearing
a chef’s hat.

545
00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:45.724
I mean, I didn’t get this...
This isn’t military issue.

546
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:47.476
I bought this at
Ross Dress for Less for like $30

547
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.228
’cause I thought it was
gonna be cold in the van.

548
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:52.982
Most of you will deploy
with D-Force.

549
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.193
The rest will jump with R-Force.

550
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:58.904
The screen on your Jump-band
indicates deployment.

551
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:01.365
-Check it now.
-

552
00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:05.536
Oh. I guess we’re together.

553
00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:06.954
I’m Charlie.

554
00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:08.664
Dan.

555
00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.749
-How are you?
-Hey. R-Force.

556
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:12.334
DORIAN: You can braid
each other’s hair later.

557
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:13.711
All right, stop talking.

558
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:14.962
Listen.

559
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:16.547
Totally. Uh, sorry.

560
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.507
I-I mean, when I’m nervous,
I talk, and...

561
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.470
On a scale of one to ten,

562
00:29:22.553 --> 00:29:24.221
I’m like a 97
on the nervous scale.

563
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.265
Or maybe a... like a 98.

564
00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:27.766
You look like a murderer.

565
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:30.311
No offense. Well...

566
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:31.645
-I mean, you do, so...
-Hey.

567
00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:32.938
-Hmm? -He will kill you
before the aliens do.

568
00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:34.064
I know.
I called him a murderer.

569
00:29:34.148 --> 00:29:36.066
-T-Turn around, man.
-I am.

570
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.443
HART:
Does anyone have any questions?

571
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.819
I missed all of that.

572
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:42.198
CHARLIE: You know that guy
in the red shirt?

573
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.825
His name’s Dorian.

574
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:47.870
He’s one of the sole survivors
of the first jump to Russia.

575
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:50.789
This is his third tour.

576
00:29:50.873 --> 00:29:52.625
What?

577
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:55.127
CHARLIE: Yeah. You see that claw
around his neck?

578
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.670
That is supposed to be from

579
00:29:56.754 --> 00:29:59.381
one of the first Whitespikes
ever killed.

580
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:02.635
He’s flipping us off.

581
00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:04.261
I think she’s flipping you off.

582
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.971
She? Oh.

583
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:08.474
-That’s my bad.
-What’d you do before all this?

584
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:10.726
Well, I was department chair
at Georgia Tech.

585
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.437
Doctorate in Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences.

586
00:30:13.521 --> 00:30:17.024
Now I’m director of R and D
at Wallace Technology.

587
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:18.275
We’re the fastest-growing

588
00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:19.818
geothermal energy company
in the U.S.

589
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:21.403
Oh, wow.

590
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.949
Okay, so I have, like, a theory.

591
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:26.742
Mm-hmm.

592
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.827
Have you noticed how all of us--

593
00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.955
or at least most of us--

594
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:32.331
are, like, over 40?

595
00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:35.042
DAN:
Yeah. You’re thinking that,

596
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.752
in order for the time jump
to occur,

597
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.338
we have to be dead in the time
we’re jumping to?

598
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:42.675
I mean, I imagine it’s to...
to avoid some sort of paradox.

599
00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:44.176
Which would lead me to believe

600
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.428
that’s why the people
training us are so young.

601
00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:50.891
BOTH:
They haven’t been born yet.

602
00:30:50.975 --> 00:30:53.143
I think we’re
gonna be best friends.

603
00:30:53.227 --> 00:30:54.770
HART:
Welcome to R-Force,

604
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.981
also known as Research Force.

605
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.525
You’ll be joining
your counterparts in 2051

606
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.402
at a fortified
research facility.

607
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.404
Your function is to add

608
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:05.447
your knowledge
and skill set to theirs

609
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.992
-and prevent our extinction.
-NORAH: Excuse me.

610
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:10.494
Why don’t we just jump back
to earlier in the war?

611
00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:12.997
The Jumplink doesn’t
work that way.

612
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.039
Jumplink?

613
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:16.083
It’s the temporal
displacement device

614
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:18.669
housed in a fortified location
in the middle of the ocean,

615
00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:21.088
and it’s what makes
all your armbands work.

616
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:23.757
Time only flows
in one direction.

617
00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:25.467
It’s like a river.

618
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:29.680
The Jumplink placed two rafts
on that river, 30 years apart.

619
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:32.141
Now, we can jump
back and forth between them,

620
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.435
but both rafts will always
keep moving forward.

621
00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:38.188
So, why can’t we just build
more rafts?

622
00:31:38.272 --> 00:31:40.190
The Jumplink tech
is held together

623
00:31:40.274 --> 00:31:42.693
with chewing gum
and chicken wire.

624
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:46.905
We’ve barely managed to make
one very rudimentary wormhole.

625
00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:48.657
If we weren’t in
an extinction-level event,

626
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.451
we’d still be jumping lab rats.

627
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:53.370
Now, we can jump you to 2051,
and we can jump you back.

628
00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:54.788
Period.

629
00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:57.958
HART: Every six days,
the Whitespikes disappear.

630
00:31:58.042 --> 00:32:00.210
They crawl back
into their nests.

631
00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:02.212
We call it the Sabbath.

632
00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:03.881
Their day of rest.

633
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:06.133
And that’s when
we insert troops.

634
00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:08.719
Okay, but why don’t we have
pictures or video?

635
00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:11.138
You know, it would help us
to know what we’re up against.

636
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:14.266
The consensus was that
if the public saw

637
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.477
what they’d face
when they reach the future,

638
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.064
it would become virtually
impossible to fill that hangar.

639
00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:22.232
Okay, cool.

640
00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:25.361
Next time someone asks that,
you should probably just lie.

641
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:28.030
-Oh, come on, man.

642
00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:29.782
WOMAN: Palms together.
Take a breath in.

643
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:31.325
-And then exhale.
-

644
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:33.619
Bring your hands
through that center.

645
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:34.953
Close your eyes.

646
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:37.289
Small breath in and out.

647
00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:42.211
I mean, out of all this stuff,

648
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:44.797
you couldn’t put one thing
of floss in here?

649
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.674
DAN:
What’s up, man?

650
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.175
-You doing all right?
-Oh, no, yeah.

651
00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.593
No, I’m-I’m good.

652
00:32:50.636 --> 00:32:52.554
Going to war.

653
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:56.266
But you survived jellyfish
season, so you can survive this.

654
00:32:57.518 --> 00:32:59.103
-The shirt.
-Shirt.

655
00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.523
You know, actually, I didn’t.

656
00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:05.401
My wife got this for me
as a joke

657
00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:08.112
’cause I got stung
so many times.

658
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:10.197
I... I hate...

659
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.199
I hate the beach.

660
00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:13.826
I hate it.

661
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:16.578
My wife, of course,
she loves it.

662
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.207
We went this summer
right before she...

663
00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:28.048
She, uh... she got sent out
in the first wave.

664
00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:31.885
I’m really sorry.

665
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:33.804
Yeah.

666
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:35.889
Uh, how about you, man?

667
00:33:35.973 --> 00:33:37.391
You got a family?

668
00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:38.934
-HART: All right, people!

669
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.562
Let’s go! This is not a drill!

670
00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:43.981
Move your bodies! Let’s go!

671
00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.691
This is not a drill!

672
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.860
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Let’s go! Let’s go!

673
00:33:47.943 --> 00:33:49.069
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What’s going on?

674
00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:50.237
I thought we had seven days.

675
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.613
The world doesn’t end
on a schedule.

676
00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:53.323
Uh, well, we’re not ready
for any kind of deployment.

677
00:33:53.407 --> 00:33:54.992
We don’t even know
what we’re going on to do.

678
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.493
You’ll get your assignment
in the LZ.

679
00:33:56.577 --> 00:33:58.620
Stay on comms. You’ll be
contacted as soon as you land.

680
00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:00.372
DAN: Some of these guys are very
green. Do they all need to go?

681
00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:01.999
Why can’t some of them stay here
and train some more?

682
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.250
The research facility
is under attack.

683
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.085
It’s the last lab left
studying the Whitespikes.

684
00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:06.837
If it’s lost, the war is lost.

685
00:34:16.722 --> 00:34:18.307
MAN:
Reach out in space! Let’s go!

686
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.725
ENGINEER
Commencing countdown protocol.

687
00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:21.477
One minute to jump.

688
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.039
DIAZ:
Be prepared for a drop.

689
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:45.626
The Jumplink will drop you five
to ten feet above the ground.

690
00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:47.002
That should be fun.

691
00:34:48.337 --> 00:34:49.922
30 seconds.

692
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:51.381
Weapons up.

693
00:34:57.137 --> 00:34:59.097
Oh, here. Come on.

694
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.725
Take that, and just
flip it around like that.

695
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:04.478
Makes sense.

696
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:05.896
DAN:
And that’s your safety.

697
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:07.898
Okay. How do you know how to do
all this stuff, man?

698
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:09.691
How are you so calm?

699
00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:11.151
Long story.

700
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:13.195
What, are you, like,
ex-military?

701
00:35:14.238 --> 00:35:15.656
Yeah.

702
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:17.366
Kind of a short story, I guess.

703
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:19.284
20 seconds.

704
00:35:19.368 --> 00:35:21.203
Tuck position.

705
00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:23.664
Where are we going?

706
00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:25.374
Miami Beach.

707
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.334
Of course
it’d have to be a beach.

708
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:31.839
ENGINEER:
Ten, nine,

709
00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:34.424
eight, seven,

710
00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:36.385
six, five,

711
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:39.388
four, three,

712
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:41.682
two, one.

713
00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.851
Launch.

714
00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:46.603
-

715
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:08.542
Lieutenant, something’s wrong
with the output coordinates.

716
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.377
Should we abort?

717
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.308
-

718
00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:06.767
Dan! Dan!

719
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.866
I got you. Come on.

720
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:34.169
You got to get up. I got you.

721
00:37:59.403 --> 00:38:01.989
Welcome to Miami.

722
00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:05.450
I’m just glad Will Smith
isn’t alive to see this.

723
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:12.040
-

724
00:38:12.124 --> 00:38:14.459
Well, I could’ve done
without seeing that.

725
00:38:14.543 --> 00:38:16.003
Well, if you think this is bad,

726
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.921
you don’t want to see
what happens next.

727
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:35.939
ROMEO COMMAND:
Where are they?

728
00:38:36.023 --> 00:38:37.858
Somebody find out
what the hell went wrong.

729
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:39.609
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.

730
00:38:39.693 --> 00:38:41.653
Do you copy me?
Can anybody hear me?

731
00:38:41.737 --> 00:38:43.613
We need the comms up now.
Come on.

732
00:38:43.697 --> 00:38:45.490
Get me someone on this radio
right now.

733
00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:47.159
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.

734
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:49.661
Do you copy?
Can anybody hear me?

735
00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:51.788
Yeah. Command, this is Actual.
We’re here.

736
00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:53.373
Some of us.

737
00:38:53.457 --> 00:38:55.000
ROMEO COMMAND:
Identify yourself.

738
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:57.085
I’m-I’m Dan Forester.

739
00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:58.920
Dan Forester.

740
00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:03.050
Okay, Dan, listen up.

741
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:04.926
I got imagery up of your team,

742
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.138
and I see that you’re a soldier,
so I’m gonna be real with you.

743
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.765
Whitespikes have
overrun the city,

744
00:39:09.848 --> 00:39:11.683
and we can’t stop them,
so we’re gonna have to clean it.

745
00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:12.768
Clean it?

746
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:14.311
A blanket bombardment
has been ordered.

747
00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:16.480
Get me an ETA on that right now.

748
00:39:16.563 --> 00:39:18.190
-On me.
-They’re going to eradicate

749
00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:19.900
every living thing
till there is nothing left.

750
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:24.404
Wait.
They’re gonna do that to here?

751
00:39:24.488 --> 00:39:25.614
ROMEO COMMAND:
I got one problem, Dan,

752
00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:26.782
and I’m gonna need your help.

753
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.658
Get me that map
of the lab-- now.

754
00:39:28.742 --> 00:39:32.579
My research team is stranded
in a lab by your location,

755
00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:34.623
and they are surrounded
by the enemy,

756
00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:38.001
so you and your unit are now
on a rescue mission.

757
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:40.545
And since you have experience
running CSAR,

758
00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:43.048
I need you to get my team
out of there.

759
00:39:44.091 --> 00:39:45.300
You got it, Dan?

760
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.010
Copy that, Command.
Listen, everybody.

761
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:48.678
We’re on a CSAR, all right?

762
00:39:48.762 --> 00:39:50.430
It’s combat search and rescue.

763
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:53.350
Our destination is
this research facility.

764
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:57.104
I need every able-bodied person
on this rooftop to follow me!

765
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:18.625
Okay.

766
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.418
We need someone on point.
What’s your name?

767
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:21.962
-Norah.
-Norah?

768
00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:23.755
-What’s your name?
-Norah.

769
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:25.590
-Robert Cowan.
-Cowan. Okay.

770
00:40:25.674 --> 00:40:27.676
You guys hustle up there,

771
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.511
look down the street,
tell me what you see.

772
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:30.804
-Okay? Go.
-NORAH: Okay.

773
00:40:36.977 --> 00:40:39.229
DAN All right,
guys, what are we looking at?

774
00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:41.773
NORAH:
Car on fire.

775
00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:43.400
A scooter.

776
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.277
-No aliens.
-Copy that.

777
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.444
Let’s move.

778
00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:10.135
Romeo Command,
we have multiple KIA.

779
00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:13.054
Is there anyone left here alive?

780
00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.140
Only the research team, I hope.

781
00:41:15.223 --> 00:41:17.184
Everybody else was ordered
to evacuate.

782
00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:27.569
DAN:
Guys, situational awareness.

783
00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:30.572
Eyes up, down, all around.

784
00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.742
You’re wasting your time
training them to be soldiers.

785
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:36.995
DAN: I’m not. Just trying
to keep them alive, man.

786
00:41:38.872 --> 00:41:41.833
Listen, you and your team seem
to be the only people out here

787
00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:43.418
who know what the hell
they’re doing.

788
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:44.878
I could really use your help.

789
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:47.339
You try to save your friends,
you’re gonna get eaten.

790
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.049
We’re Team Not Eaten.

791
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:52.427
Did he just say they’d eat us?

792
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.095
Yes.

793
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.348
-What was that?

794
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:05.649
DAN:
Romeo Command, we’re approaching

795
00:42:05.732 --> 00:42:07.567
the research facility
from the southeast corner.

796
00:42:07.651 --> 00:42:09.194
All right,
proceed to the lab on seven.

797
00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:10.278
DAN:
Copy that.

798
00:42:45.772 --> 00:42:47.190
ROMEO COMMAND:
Dan, you should know

799
00:42:47.274 --> 00:42:49.609
the Whitespikes can smell blood
from a mile away.

800
00:42:50.652 --> 00:42:52.279
So be careful.

801
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:09.087
CHARLIE:
Is that... is that one of them?

802
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:12.299
What is he doing?

803
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:17.429
He’s taking souvenirs.

804
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:19.222
CHARLIE:
Uh, excuse me.

805
00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:21.266
Uh, you can’t take that
with you.

806
00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:26.271
Shh.

807
00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:28.732
This guy shushes me.

808
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.109
Dan. You got to see this.

809
00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:34.571
What is that?

810
00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:43.830
Command, we found your team.

811
00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:46.916
No survivors.

812
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.838
All right, Dan, I’m gonna
need you to head to the row

813
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:54.299
of biomedical freezers
along the south wall in the lab.

814
00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:57.093
Dan, if they left bodies behind,
they’re gonna come back.

815
00:43:57.177 --> 00:43:58.470
So you need to move fast.

816
00:43:59.763 --> 00:44:01.806
The lab director’s
office is on your left.

817
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.225
-Get the hard drives.
-Copy that. You got that?

818
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:05.727
-I got it.
-This office right here.

819
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.146
All data, all hard drives,
everything.

820
00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:10.065
Entering the lab.
What are we looking for?

821
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.233
ROMEO COMMAND: I need
all the biological material

822
00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:15.653
from lab one, and I need those
blue ampoules from lab two.

823
00:44:16.696 --> 00:44:18.281
On me. Lab two.

824
00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:22.410
Oh, no. I see something.

825
00:44:23.953 --> 00:44:25.372
NORAH:
Where?

826
00:44:25.455 --> 00:44:26.998
I don’t see anything.

827
00:44:27.082 --> 00:44:29.459
Guys, something’s watching us.

828
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:31.002
What? Like Whitespikes?

829
00:44:31.086 --> 00:44:33.213
-Well, duh.
-COWAN: It’s moving.

830
00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:34.798
You-you don’t see it?

831
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:36.341
Colonel, they’re gonna
start the bombing.

832
00:44:41.554 --> 00:44:43.348
Where are these blue ampoules?

833
00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:44.808
ROMEO COMMAND:
Along the south wall.

834
00:44:44.891 --> 00:44:46.226
How many we looking at?

835
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:48.103
12, Dan. I need all of them.

836
00:44:52.732 --> 00:44:54.651
-Got ’em. -All right,
ready the extraction team.

837
00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:56.111
We need to get ’em
out of there right now!

838
00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:57.695
-Yes, ma’am.
-Watch team, fall back.

839
00:44:57.779 --> 00:44:59.155
Shit.

840
00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:00.740
Cowan?

841
00:45:00.824 --> 00:45:02.659
I want you to rendezvous with me

842
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:04.536
in the laboratory on the
seventh floor. You understand?

843
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.121
Lab on seven. Copy.

844
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
let’s move now! We got to go.

845
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:20.385
ROMEO COMMAND: These bombs are
gonna drop in six minutes,

846
00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:22.387
and there’s nothing
I can do about it,

847
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.639
-so you need to move fast.
-DAN: Let’s go!

848
00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:30.770
We do not want to go
out the front door.

849
00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:32.355
I’m not sure if something’s
out there or not.

850
00:45:32.439 --> 00:45:33.523
Command, we need a new exit.

851
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:34.774
ROMEO COMMAND:
Head to the loading dock

852
00:45:34.858 --> 00:45:36.192
at the back,
and take the rear stairwell.

853
00:45:36.276 --> 00:45:38.194
South stairwell. Copy that.

854
00:47:24.384 --> 00:47:26.386
Keep an eye out.

855
00:47:51.703 --> 00:47:54.122
Uh, guys?

856
00:48:28.865 --> 00:48:30.241
That’s them!

857
00:48:31.618 --> 00:48:32.952
Contact above!

858
00:48:33.036 --> 00:48:34.871
Fire!

859
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.217
Downstairs! Go now! Move!

860
00:48:57.226 --> 00:48:58.603
Come on!

861
00:49:29.884 --> 00:49:31.302
Oh, shit.

862
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.722
Oh, shit!

863
00:49:34.806 --> 00:49:36.557
Shit, shit, shit, shit,

864
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:38.518
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,

865
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:40.311
shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,

866
00:49:40.395 --> 00:49:43.606
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,

867
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.442
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,

868
00:49:46.526 --> 00:49:48.778
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

869
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:51.030
-Go!
-Oh, shit, shit!

870
00:49:52.365 --> 00:49:54.325
Oh, shit!

871
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.745
Move, move, move! Move now! Go!

872
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.544
Go, go! Get out of here!

873
00:50:40.163 --> 00:50:41.789
Necks or the bellies.

874
00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:44.792
That’s the only lethal part
on their body. Let’s go!

875
00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:46.294
Let’s go!

876
00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:59.640
ROMEO COMMAND:
Can anybody hear me?

877
00:50:59.724 --> 00:51:01.434
Get those Humvees on site now!

878
00:51:01.517 --> 00:51:03.561
You heard the colonel.
We need transport now. Let’s go!

879
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:05.563
SOLDIER
Recon, Alpha-- one minute.

880
00:51:05.646 --> 00:51:07.064
We can’t afford to lose them.

881
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:08.608
Romeo Actual, the bombing’s
gonna commence in three minutes.

882
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.068
You have got to get
out of there.

883
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:14.071
PILOT: Bravo inbound.
Time to target: 60 seconds.

884
00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:15.323
MAN
Go weapons hot.

885
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:17.992
All right, Actual,
you need to head left

886
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.077
at the next intersection.
You got Whitespikes

887
00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:22.705
closing in on you
from the north and the south.

888
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:24.791
Uh, Command, we’re going right!

889
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:29.420
Okay, but you need to stay away
from areas with red smoke.

890
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:36.969
PILOT:
Contact acquired.

891
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:38.513
Red smoke visible
at two o’clock.

892
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:40.056
Form up on me.

893
00:51:45.645 --> 00:51:46.771
Yes! Oh, my God!

894
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.402
COWAN:
What the hell, man?

895
00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:56.948
Attack!

896
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.539
Contact rear!

897
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.928
-DAN: Move!
-Move!

898
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.806
PILOT:
Approaching target.

899
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.392
Fox one, package inbound.

900
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:26.602
Bravo, on me. Danger close.

901
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.503
-Dan, get the hell out of there
right now. -Yeah, no shit!

902
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.018
Enemy’s swarming
the target location.

903
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.477
Bravo team, let’s hit it again.

904
00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:10.313
Move now!

905
00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:11.689
Go!

906
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:15.192
Come on!

907
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:25.119
PILOT:
1-1-5, weapons free.

908
00:53:31.292 --> 00:53:33.544
Bravo 2-8 on-site, fully armed.

909
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:35.254
There’s a shit ton of Spikes
down there.

910
00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:37.715
Friendlies on the ground,
take cover.

911
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.592
Get out of there. Move now.

912
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.969
DAN:
We’re working on it.

913
00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:48.726
-We got to go!
-DAN: No, we can’t leave him.

914
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:50.186
PILOT:
Final approach, package east.

915
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:51.604
T minus 30 seconds.

916
00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:52.688
Colonel, they’re not
gonna make it.

917
00:53:52.772 --> 00:53:53.856
Dan, what is your status?

918
00:53:59.362 --> 00:54:00.404
Let’s go!

919
00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.784
ROMEO COMMAND: Dan, you are
in the line of fire.

920
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:07.161
You have got to get
out of there.

921
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:09.330
Goddamn it, Dan,
get the hell out of there!

922
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.123
-Working on it, Command.
-Go!

923
00:54:11.207 --> 00:54:12.708
Come on! Let’s go! Move!

924
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:14.585
-Just go!
-We got this!

925
00:54:14.669 --> 00:54:17.296
-Go!

926
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:27.390
800 meters. Let’s take ’em down.

927
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.772
PILOT:
Weapons free.

928
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:27.324
Hey. Charlie.

929
00:55:27.408 --> 00:55:29.076
You okay?

930
00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.718
Jesus.

931
00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:57.271
Where the hell are we?

932
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.982
Well, we’re not in Miami
anymore, that’s for sure.

933
00:56:01.317 --> 00:56:03.110
WOMAN
Additional personnel required

934
00:56:03.194 --> 00:56:05.154
for off-loading.

935
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.532
All personnel, clear the deck
for incoming.

936
00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:11.368
Come on.

937
00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:15.748
DAN:
Hey.

938
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:20.544
Where is everybody?

939
00:56:22.254 --> 00:56:23.881
What do you think?

940
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.303
You should’ve kept going

941
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:32.473
instead of jumping into that
tunnel to save your friends.

942
00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:34.391
We’re here to save people.

943
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:35.851
We got to try.

944
00:56:35.935 --> 00:56:37.561
We’re on a mission.

945
00:56:37.645 --> 00:56:38.979
That’s what we’re here to do.

946
00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:40.689
But you didn’t.

947
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.485
Did you?

948
00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:47.071
You’ll see.

949
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:49.698
Nothing we do here matters.

950
00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:51.659
That’s where you’re wrong.

951
00:56:54.078 --> 00:56:55.871
I don’t believe that one bit.

952
00:56:55.955 --> 00:56:57.790
I don’t think
you believe that, either.

953
00:56:57.873 --> 00:56:59.333
You don’t know me.

954
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.502
If nothing matters,
what are you doing here?

955
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:03.587
Three deployments.

956
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:07.007
Why you got that...

957
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:08.551
souvenir around your neck?

958
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:10.469
It’s not a souvenir.

959
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:13.764
It’s a reminder.

960
00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:16.267
Of what?

961
00:57:20.646 --> 00:57:24.650
Reminds me of the one thing
I learned the day I got drafted.

962
00:57:27.653 --> 00:57:30.614
I’ll be dead in six months.
Cancer.

963
00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:33.200
So here’s what I’m gonna do.

964
00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:36.912
I’m gonna keep living my life...

965
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:39.331
the way I want to,

966
00:57:39.415 --> 00:57:42.835
and I’m gonna die
the way I want to.

967
00:57:45.588 --> 00:57:48.591
I’d rather die here
than a slow death back home.

968
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:52.553
Dan Forester.

969
00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:53.846
That’s me.

970
00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:55.431
Command wants to see you.

971
00:57:55.514 --> 00:57:58.017
You two,
you’re gonna be redeployed.

972
00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.602
Nope.

973
00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:01.353
I’m dead, man. I can’t...
You kidding me?

974
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:03.105
-I can’t do this again.
-DAN: Yes, you can.

975
00:58:03.189 --> 00:58:04.523
I’m gonna get killed,
or I’m gonna kill somebody else.

976
00:58:04.607 --> 00:58:06.483
-Yes, you can.
-

977
00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:08.652
And you will.

978
00:58:09.945 --> 00:58:10.988
Okay.

979
00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:13.282
-Yeah.
-All right.

980
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.869
Take care of him.

981
00:58:18.037 --> 00:58:20.039
OFFICER:
Sir, we don’t have all day.

982
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.628
Okay. I can survive this.

983
00:58:25.711 --> 00:58:28.005
No, you can’t.

984
00:58:28.088 --> 00:58:29.506
Well, don’t laugh.

985
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:31.508
You don’t laugh if somebody says
they’re gonna survive something.

986
00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:32.927
ROMEO COMMAND:
These have to make it

987
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.428
to Deepswell in one piece.

988
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:35.888
Copy that.

989
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:37.806
Romeo Command?

990
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:40.351
I believe we’ve met already.

991
00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:42.561
Dan Forester.

992
00:58:42.645 --> 00:58:45.981
Yes, uh, thank you
for recovering the ampoules.

993
00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:47.816
My pleasure. Yeah.

994
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.652
And for trying to find my team.

995
00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.613
I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry.

996
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:54.073
Colonel Forester.

997
00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:56.325
-I’m not a colonel.
-Excuse me.

998
00:58:56.408 --> 00:58:57.368
They’re starting in 20, Colonel.

999
00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:58.452
Copy. Thank you.

1000
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:02.164
Colonel Forester.

1001
00:59:02.248 --> 00:59:05.251
First Sergeant Dan Forester,
Special Forces.

1002
00:59:05.334 --> 00:59:07.920
Uh, former, in a past life.

1003
00:59:08.003 --> 00:59:10.506
Forester. That’s funny.

1004
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:13.884
Uh, you spell that... one "R"?

1005
00:59:13.968 --> 00:59:15.636
Just one "R."

1006
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.012
Me, too.

1007
00:59:17.096 --> 00:59:19.014
Wait, where...

1008
00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:22.351
Where your people from?

1009
00:59:24.019 --> 00:59:26.063
Same place that you’re from.

1010
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.407
Muri.

1011
00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:39.952
You’re my Muri Forester?

1012
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:42.579
I’m Muri Forester.

1013
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:44.665
Wow.

1014
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.753
You got, uh...

1015
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.381
-Old?
-

1016
00:59:52.464 --> 00:59:54.091
No, you look great. You, uh...

1017
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.010
I mean, just...

1018
00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.514
Compared to
the last time I saw you, you...

1019
01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.602
Y-You...

1020
01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.438
I didn’t know if you were alive.

1021
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:08.897
Don’t.

1022
01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.318
Okay.

1023
01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.532
Let’s take a walk.

1024
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.501
MAN:
Colonel.

1025
01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.296
Colonel Forester--
gonna take me a minute

1026
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.381
to get used to that one.

1027
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.842
I have a few different titles.

1028
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.135
I guess when you’re down

1029
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.095
to less than 500,000 people
on the planet,

1030
01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:42.806
you wear a few hats.

1031
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.143
I always figured you would’ve
went into science.

1032
01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.145
I did.

1033
01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:51.732
R-Force is my creation.
I’m the lead researcher.

1034
01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.360
Wow. Come on.

1035
01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:56.612
Yeah, I have a PhD
in biotechnology

1036
01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.115
with an emphasis
in genomics and immunology.

1037
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.787
Cal State?

1038
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.705
MIT.

1039
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.251
MIT?

1040
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.425
Well, I hope I was proud of you.

1041
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.638
I am. I’m proud of you.

1042
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.020
Look, you need
to understand something.

1043
01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.024
This is the end.

1044
01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:36.944
Within the next few weeks,
the human species will disappear

1045
01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.779
from the face of the earth.

1046
01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:43.534
We are literally living
on borrowed time.

1047
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.077
So you should know that

1048
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.371
nothing about this for me
is sentimental.

1049
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:49.665
I didn’t in any way
bring you here

1050
01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.501
because I wanted
to spend time with my father.

1051
01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:54.420
I brought you here for a reason.

1052
01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.258
Well, what’s the reason?

1053
01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.138
I’ll tell you
when you need to know.

1054
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.852
Yes, ma’am.

1055
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.442
Do you want to see something
really dangerous?

1056
01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.695
I feel like literally
that’s all I’ve been doing

1057
01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.905
since I got here, but okay.

1058
01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.242
What is that?
That’s not what I saw in Miami.

1059
01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.411
No, the ones that you fought
in Miami were the males.

1060
01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.413
This is a female.

1061
01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.040
She’s very aggressive
and much more rare.

1062
01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:33.459
They typically nest underground,

1063
01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:34.918
and the males are
fiercely protective.

1064
01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:36.503
They would die to defend her.

1065
01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:39.465
All they seem to care about is
the survival of the species.

1066
01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:40.966
Attention!

1067
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.509
MURI:
Carry on.

1068
01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.511
All right, listen up, everybody.

1069
01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.054
Greenwood, this is Dan Forester.

1070
01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:47.973
He’s gonna be joining us
for the extraction.

1071
01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.683
He’s gonna need full armor.

1072
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.977
The toxin kills the males
just fine.

1073
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.604
It makes quite a mess of them,
actually.

1074
01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.731
But when we sent a team in
to clean out the nests,

1075
01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:59.359
we found dozens of dead males
and her.

1076
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.653
DAN: So the females
survive the toxin.

1077
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.447
And now you want to find out
why it didn’t kill her?

1078
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.325
In order to find out what can.

1079
01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.701
Vipers Two, Three and Four
are ready

1080
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.077
to sedate and cage the female.

1081
01:03:09.161 --> 01:03:11.371
Greenwood and I will provide
recon and air support.

1082
01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:14.374
-Got it? Any questions?
-No, ma’am.

1083
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:17.794
MURI: Her physiology is the key
to their extinction.

1084
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.713
It’s kind of our last hope.

1085
01:03:20.756 --> 01:03:22.132
Last hope for what?

1086
01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:25.802
At finding something
that will kill them all.

1087
01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.680
Okay. We’re in and out
real quick. Let’s go.

1088
01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:03.173
DAN:
They’re everywhere.

1089
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.717
Yeah, one day,
they were just here.

1090
01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.098
They were stealthy.

1091
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.641
They landed somewhere remote,

1092
01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.685
avoided all satellite imagery
and radar.

1093
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.854
They started
tearing apart Russia.

1094
01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.065
Three years later,
every major landmass--

1095
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.984
North and South America,
Australia,

1096
01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:24.570
Asia, Africa, Europe--
are devoid of human life.

1097
01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:27.739
Three years. I mean, they must
be reproducing so fast.

1098
01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:29.908
They have no use
for prisoners or government,

1099
01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:32.661
technology, money-- nothing.

1100
01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:36.498
We are food.

1101
01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:38.709
And they are hungry.

1102
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.222
Muri, when they gave me this...

1103
01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.309
...they said, uh...

1104
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.478
...they said I’d die
in seven years.

1105
01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:06.778
Yeah, last time I saw you
was the day that you died.

1106
01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.367
It’s like seeing a ghost.

1107
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.788
What happened?

1108
01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.293
What happened? Like...

1109
01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.961
how-how did you die?

1110
01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.463
No.

1111
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.549
What happened before I died?

1112
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.802
What happened to me?

1113
01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.556
Wh... You know,
what happened to your mom?

1114
01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:40.437
I think the less that we say
to each other, the better.

1115
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.863
PILOT: Ranger Team One,
Viper Five coming topside.

1116
01:05:57.663 --> 01:05:59.581
MURI:
Has the female been sedated?

1117
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:03.251
RANGER: We’re throwing
everything we can at her.

1118
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:06.129
Fire team has her cornered.

1119
01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.964
She’s in Cave One.

1120
01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.758
RANGER 2:
We tranqed her pretty hard.

1121
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.135
She’s fighting it,
but she’s feeling it.

1122
01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:13.679
We could use some help

1123
01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:15.639
-getting her in the cage.
-Roger. Rope.

1124
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.536
Keep pulling!

1125
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.498
-Got to fight.

1126
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.468
Come on.

1127
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.914
RANGER
Man down! Man down!

1128
01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:24.750
All right, take it down
and give me cover.

1129
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.418
-We’re going in.
-Yeah, I need a gun.

1130
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:28.253
No, you’re staying in the helo.
You’re up.

1131
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.816
RANGER:
Go, go, go!

1132
01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.452
Someone get a harpoon
on that tentacle!

1133
01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:06.666
R Team, incoming, Cave Two!

1134
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.001
Fire in the hole!

1135
01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.283
MURI:
Get ready.

1136
01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:42.661
I’m about to piss her off.

1137
01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.251
-Greenwood, now!

1138
01:08:57.217 --> 01:08:58.760
Pull!

1139
01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.764
-Pull her in the cage!
-Do it now!

1140
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.200
RANGER
The colonel is down.

1141
01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.953
I repeat, the colonel is down!

1142
01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.413
Stay in the helo.

1143
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.826
DAN:
Hang on!

1144
01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.209
-Now!

1145
01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.170
-Come on, pull!

1146
01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:48.370
We got her ass.

1147
01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:54.626
Viper One, get her out of here.
We’ll get the next one.

1148
01:10:57.045 --> 01:10:59.756
Viper Four, enemy contact--
your three o’clock!

1149
01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.553
Run!

1150
01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.408
-Cover!
-Go!

1151
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.608
You put yourself in danger.

1152
01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.026
I made a judgment call.

1153
01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.820
Yeah, you could’ve screwed up
my mission.

1154
01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.906
I was trying to help.

1155
01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.867
That’s not what
I asked you to do.

1156
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.786
I need you to stay alive.

1157
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.329
You were under attack.

1158
01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:55.830
I wasn’t gonna sit in a helo

1159
01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:57.999
and listen to my daughter
get eaten.

1160
01:12:58.083 --> 01:12:59.501
Sorry.

1161
01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:01.127
I’m still your dad.

1162
01:13:06.508 --> 01:13:08.593
You know, I used to want
to be like you.

1163
01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:14.808
I wanted to be you.

1164
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.060
I believed in you
when nobody else did.

1165
01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.856
And then?

1166
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.692
What? What happened?

1167
01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.986
Talking about a period
of my life that I haven’t lived

1168
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.196
but you have.

1169
01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.614
Enlighten me. What happened?

1170
01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.366
You left us.

1171
01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:33.326
Bullshit. No, I didn’t.

1172
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.911
Yeah, you left us.

1173
01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.998
That nearly killed Mom,
you know.

1174
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.711
She believed in you, too.

1175
01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:45.213
Just like I did.

1176
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.425
I know for a fact
I would never leave you.

1177
01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:53.763
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

1178
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:04.607
When I was 12,
you guys separated.

1179
01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:10.572
And then you told me that
everything was gonna be okay.

1180
01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:14.033
And then, when I was 14,
you divorced.

1181
01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.333
You never seemed happy
with your life.

1182
01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:27.046
And then, on my 16th...

1183
01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.766
We got a call from the hospital.

1184
01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.688
You were in a car accident.

1185
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.946
I was there in the ICU.

1186
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.202
I heard your last heartbeat
on the monitor.

1187
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.705
I was there...

1188
01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.541
when everyone rushed in
and they pushed me away.

1189
01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:08.713
And I watched them shock you
over and over again.

1190
01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.510
You know, Mom had tried
to help me

1191
01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.804
separate from you, but I, um...

1192
01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.723
I couldn’t.

1193
01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:24.687
I didn’t want to,
because I wanted you to see me.

1194
01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:31.027
I wanted you to hear me.
I wanted you to...

1195
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.072
to fix it and...
and save our family.

1196
01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:36.407
I didn’t want you to walk away.

1197
01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:43.831
And then you were gone.

1198
01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.609
PILOT: Deepswell-9,
Viper Actual on approach.

1199
01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.196
WOMAN: Copy, Actual.
Drone escort en route.

1200
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.626
DAN: Excuse me. I’m looking
for Colonel Forester.

1201
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.128
Thank you.

1202
01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:26.351
Good morning.

1203
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:27.852
Morning.

1204
01:17:29.187 --> 01:17:31.272
How are you holding up?

1205
01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:33.274
Oh, I’m okay.

1206
01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.570
I’m good.

1207
01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.370
Want to give me a hand?

1208
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.164
Yeah.

1209
01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.124
Yeah, uh...

1210
01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.751
What can I do?

1211
01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:55.338
Uh, just grab that controller
and, uh, take her up for me.

1212
01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:02.678
It’s the top left switch.

1213
01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:05.264
Ugh. She stinks.

1214
01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:08.226
Yeah, she’s, um, secreting
something like sweat.

1215
01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:20.696
-

1216
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.158
-You sure it’s safe
to be that close? -No.

1217
01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:27.078
That’s why we sedated her.

1218
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:30.581
Gave her 180 milligrams
of hydromorphone.

1219
01:18:30.665 --> 01:18:32.917
Did you say 180 milligrams?

1220
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.460
Per day?

1221
01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:36.921
MURI:
Every hour.

1222
01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:41.467
You know, the female genetics

1223
01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:43.469
aren’t that different
from the males.

1224
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.848
The toxin still affects them,

1225
01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:50.560
but for some reason, her body is
much better at detoxifying it.

1226
01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.019
So you just got to figure out

1227
01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:53.855
what she’s using
to attack the toxin.

1228
01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.191
You can design an enzyme
inhibitor to neutralize it.

1229
01:18:57.275 --> 01:18:59.068
And then we can kill them all.

1230
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:01.737
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:03.781
MURI:
The only problem is finding out

1232
01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:06.325
what’s stopping the toxin.

1233
01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.703
It can be one of
a thousand things.

1234
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.332
We’ll need hundreds
of variations...

1235
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.712
...to make thousands of tests.

1236
01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:21.215
With any luck, we should have

1237
01:19:21.299 --> 01:19:24.218
a working female toxin
by the morning.

1238
01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:27.930
I scrounged up some dinner.

1239
01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.893
Have two options:

1240
01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:34.312
veggie lasagna and...

1241
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.855
veggie lasagna.

1242
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.316
That’s how you know
you’re near the end.

1243
01:19:41.486 --> 01:19:43.571
Okay, let’s see how fast
we can denature this thing.

1244
01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:45.364
Yeah.

1245
01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:50.119
MURI:
It’s gonna run a thousand tests.

1246
01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:52.497
See if we can break down
this sucker.

1247
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.540
We can.

1248
01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:56.626
We can. This is gonna work.

1249
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.297

the inhibitor, right?

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:09.889
Yeah, it’s not a great bond.

1253
01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.933
-It’s something, isn’t it?
-It’s something.

1254
01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.809
It’s gonna have to be
a lot stronger

1255
01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.770
so that the female doesn’t
break down that toxin,

1256
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:17.396
but it is a great start.

1257
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.482

Once you figure out this toxin,

1267
01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:58.062
do you have a way
of deploying it?

1268
01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.481
Well, I have a solution.

1269
01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:05.152

really worth talking about it

1270

works for sure.

1271
01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:09.949
Understood. Yeah.

1272
01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:12.493
You got a lot of work to do.
I’ll just...

1273
01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:14.662
I’ll make dinner.

1274
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.458
You know, there’s another

1275
01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.796

1276
01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.799
That’s when I leave.

1277
01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.342
Right.

1278
01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.720
It’s a... a big day
all around, I guess.

1279
01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:42.898
I want to help.

1280
01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:46.861
It’s okay. You know, it’s, um...

1281
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:49.488
just kind of
a one-person job anyway.

1282
01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:57.955
Muri.

1283
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:03.502
Your mom would be really proud
of you right now.

1284
01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.588
I know I am.

1285
01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.758
Good night, Chickpea.

1286
01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.694
She never quits.

1287
01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:35.034
I came down here to see
if she needed help.

1288
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.494
I should’ve known.

1289

Is that right?

1290
01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:42.333
You would know
more than anyone, right?

1291
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.506
She was nine years old
last time I saw her.

1292
01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.007
Stubborn, but...

1293

She calls it "persistent."

You know, one way or another,

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.227
this war is...

You know that?

We can’t make it here.

1323
01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:32.485
We’re on borrowed time already.

1324
01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.279
You have the resources
and the ability

1325
01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.907
to mass-produce it in your time,

1326
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:42.328

from ever happening.

Muri, what are you asking me?

1328
01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:51.962
You’re asking me to save
my future, but then what?

1329
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.132
Leave you?

another way.

I’ve thought of everything,

1335
01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:15.152
and this is the only way.

1336
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:21.408
I’m asking you to do what
no one else is willing to do.

1337
01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:24.578
Why me?

1338
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.331

Now!

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Four minutes to jump.

1404
01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.175
Move! Move! This way!

1405
01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:12.384
We’re almost there!

1406
01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:13.886

1407
01:31:22.019 --> 01:31:23.395
-Shit.
-

1408
01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.194
Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1409
01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.237
I’m... I’m okay.

1410
01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:33.488
PILOT
This is Viper One.

1411
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.532
I can’t stay here.
Spikes are all over us.

1412
01:31:39.203 --> 01:31:40.579
Put your arm around me.

1413
01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:46.460
PILOT: Colonel, meet me
at the helipad on Rig Two.

1414
01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:05.312
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Three minutes to jump.

1415
01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:24.081
PILOT: Mayday! Mayday!
Viper One going down!

1416
01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:33.340
I need you to move.

1417
01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:35.175
We got to get up.
We got to move.

1418
01:32:35.259 --> 01:32:36.385
Come on. On three.

1419
01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:37.636
-One... Hey.
-

1420
01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.597
-One, two, three.
-

1421
01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.445
MURI:
You got to leave me here.

1422
01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:56.780
DAN:
Hey.

1423
01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.158
We’ll just sit here for a while.

1424
01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:01.660
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1425
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:08.208
-I’m sorry.
-Hey.

1426
01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:12.879
I’m sorry I said
all those things to you.

1427
01:33:12.963 --> 01:33:14.464
I shouldn’t have said them.

1428
01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:16.717
I was angry, and I didn’t mean
to hurt you.

1429
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.636
-It’s okay.

1430
01:33:22.472 --> 01:33:25.392
I’m so happy
I got to see you like this--

1431
01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:27.519
how you were when I was a kid.

1432
01:33:34.318 --> 01:33:36.486
This is how I remember you.

1433
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.408
We can’t quit.
We cannot quit right now.

1434
01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:43.327
We can’t do this right now.

1435
01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:49.416
-

1436
01:33:57.883 --> 01:34:00.469
-You have to take this.
-No. No, no, no, no, no.

1437
01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.471
I’m not leaving you.

1438
01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.056
No.

1439
01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:05.766
You got to leave me.

1440
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.312
We were never going to make it.

1441
01:34:16.068 --> 01:34:19.946
You need to make sure
this never happens.

1442
01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:25.160
Yeah.

1443
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.999
I love you, Dad.

1444
01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:45.097
-No.

1445
01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.820
DAN:
Hang on!

1446
01:35:00.946 --> 01:35:03.156
AUTOMATED VOICE:
20 seconds until jump.

1447
01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:12.457
No. No.

1448
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:08.305
HART
Forester. Forester.

1449
01:36:14.394 --> 01:36:16.104
Can you hear me?

1450
01:36:18.482 --> 01:36:20.567
Forester.

1451
01:36:23.445 --> 01:36:25.071
The toxin.

1452
01:36:25.155 --> 01:36:26.364
What?

1453
01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:29.534
The green vial-- where is it?

1454
01:36:29.618 --> 01:36:30.994
It-it’s in your hand.

1455
01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:33.330
We tried to get it from you,
but you wouldn’t let us.

1456
01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:36.583
We need to mass-produce this
and send it back.

1457
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.210
It’ll kill ’em all.

1458
01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.212
The Jumplink just went off-line.

1459
01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:42.255
We can’t send anything back.

1460
01:36:42.339 --> 01:36:44.341
We can’t travel to the future.

1461
01:36:45.926 --> 01:36:47.594
It’s over.

1462
01:36:48.762 --> 01:36:50.889
DAN
Oh, Muri.

1463
01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:52.474
WOMAN
Lieutenant Hart,

1464
01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:53.934
please report to command now.

1465
01:36:54.017 --> 01:36:55.352
I’m sorry.

1466
01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.479
Lieutenant Hart,
please report to command.

1467
01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:59.356
DAN:
I’m sorry.

1468
01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:08.156
Charlie.

1469
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:11.117
You made it.

1470
01:37:18.542 --> 01:37:20.377
I hid.

1471
01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:28.361
Daddy!

1472
01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.244
I made this for you.

1473
01:38:37.287 --> 01:38:39.080
I made it
the second that you left

1474
01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:41.708
-because I just knew you were
gonna come home. -Yeah.

1475
01:38:43.168 --> 01:38:46.004
I got sparkles all over my room.

1476
01:38:47.047 --> 01:38:48.965
And then that was my handprint.

1477
01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:51.718
Like, we painted
over top of my hand.

1478
01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:55.555
And look-- look at
all of the glitter.

1479
01:38:55.639 --> 01:38:58.850
Mommy helped me with the words.

1480
01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:00.894
Do you like it?

1481
01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.412
DAN:
What I’m about to tell you

1482
01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:02.831
is gonna be...
it’s gonna sound crazy.

1483
01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:05.500
She was there.

1484
01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.293
Our little girl.

1485
01:40:07.377 --> 01:40:09.921
She’s smart. She’s a scientist.

1486
01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.464
I don’t... W-Wait, I’m confused.

1487
01:40:11.548 --> 01:40:13.007
You saw Muri?

1488
01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:14.509
Yeah.

1489
01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:18.555
You’re saying you literally
physically saw our daughter?

1490
01:40:19.723 --> 01:40:21.391
We worked together.

1491
01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:22.809
On a toxin.

1492
01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:24.436
She figured it out.

1493
01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:26.521
She was gonna kill them all.

1494
01:40:26.604 --> 01:40:28.565
She was gonna save the world.

1495
01:40:31.693 --> 01:40:33.611
And, uh...

1496
01:40:35.155 --> 01:40:37.073
Hey, it’s okay.

1497
01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:42.328
Now I’ve got a solution

1498
01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:44.414
and no way to use it.

1499
01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:47.917
So we got to figure it out.

1500
01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:51.921
We got to figure it out.

1501
01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:55.008
Hey.

1502
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:57.010
We’re gonna figure
this out together.

1503
01:40:57.093 --> 01:40:59.387
Okay.

1504
01:40:59.471 --> 01:41:03.183
What do we know? We know when
and where they land, right?

1505
01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:06.728
The first attack
is in late summer

1506
01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:09.022
-in, uh, northern Russia, 2048.
-Okay.

1507
01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:11.900
So, what if there’s a whole army

1508
01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:14.986
waiting for them
when they get off their ships?

1509
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:17.655
Yeah. But there were no ships.

1510
01:41:17.739 --> 01:41:19.365
There was no satellite footage
of any rockets, nothing.

1511
01:41:19.449 --> 01:41:20.742
They searched everything.
They couldn’t find it.

1512
01:41:20.825 --> 01:41:22.535
They had to have
gotten here somehow.

1513
01:41:22.619 --> 01:41:24.370
Exactly. All we know is...

1514
01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:27.832
...they were just here.

1515
01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:30.460
Just because
they attacked in 2048

1516
01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.003
doesn’t mean that’s
when they got here.

1517
01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.963
What if they got here
in ’47, ’46?

1518
01:41:34.047 --> 01:41:35.590
I mean, it’s
the middle of nowhere, Russia.

1519
01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:36.800
We wouldn’t have found
their ships.

1520
01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:39.344
Because we’re looking
at the wrong year.

1521
01:41:42.931 --> 01:41:44.599
Holy shit.

1522
01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:47.811
I got to call somebody.

1523
01:41:47.894 --> 01:41:49.729
Who are you gonna tell them
came up with the solution?

1524
01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:51.731
From me. I’m gonna definitely
say that I came up with it.

1525
01:41:51.815 --> 01:41:54.400
-I think it was your wife.
-It’s all good. It’s all good.

1526
01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.904
REPORTER: With contact
to the future now severed,

1527
01:41:57.987 --> 01:42:00.406
governments have been unable
to stop rioting

1528
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:03.034
and looting from spreading
across the globe,

1529
01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:04.953
as most now believe that,
in 30 years,

1530
01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:08.039
humanity will be wiped off
the face of the earth.

1531
01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:09.958
Did you miss me?

1532
01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.793
First round is on me.

1533
01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.670
DAN: Yeah, no one’s gonna
stop you, huh?

1534
01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:15.755
DORIAN:
Mm-hmm.

1535
01:42:15.839 --> 01:42:17.048
DAN:
Dorian.

1536
01:42:18.091 --> 01:42:19.843
There’s still a chance
that we can stop

1537
01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:22.011
this war from ever happening.

1538
01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:24.305
It doesn’t look like it.

1539
01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:27.308
Told you it was all for nothing.

1540
01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:29.394
It’s too late for heroes,
Forester.

1541
01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:32.272
I’m not a hero.

1542
01:42:34.023 --> 01:42:36.526
I was trying to save
my daughter.

1543
01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:40.572
If I got to save the world
to save her,

1544
01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:43.032
then I’m damn sure gonna do it.

1545
01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:51.082
What kind of selfish dick
doesn’t help a guy

1546
01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:53.001
save his kid, right?

1547
01:42:54.252 --> 01:42:56.337
You still got that claw?

1548
01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:04.345
CHARLIE:
Well, there is something here.

1549
01:43:06.055 --> 01:43:07.724
But it’s not sediment.

1550
01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:11.978
Or blood.

1551
01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:16.566
It’s ash. It’s volcanic ash.

1552
01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:19.402
And it’s not from Russia.
It’s from China.

1553
01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:22.113
-Or Korea. Somewhere in there.
-How do you know that?

1554
01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:24.908
Oh, you want me to explain the
chemical makeup of the sediment?

1555
01:43:24.991 --> 01:43:26.200
Fuck no.

1556
01:43:26.284 --> 01:43:28.161
So, how does
Chinese volcanic ash end up

1557
01:43:28.244 --> 01:43:29.621
on an island in northern Russia?

1558
01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.706
You know any volcano experts?

1559
01:43:35.418 --> 01:43:37.420
Am I in trouble?

1560
01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:40.256
Martin, the lives of every man,

1561
01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.384
woman and child on this planet
could be saved

1562
01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:45.845
if we could just get the answer
to one question,

1563
01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:48.097
and it’s all about volcanoes.

1564
01:43:48.181 --> 01:43:49.974
I knew this would happen.

1565
01:43:50.058 --> 01:43:53.102
Oh, I would’ve killed for a
moment like this in high school.

1566
01:43:53.186 --> 01:43:55.146
How would a creature

1567
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.565
who’s only ever stepped foot
in northern Russia

1568
01:43:57.649 --> 01:44:00.693
get volcanic ash from China
or Korea under its claws?

1569
01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:05.740
Well, this would be weird,
but...

1570
01:44:05.823 --> 01:44:08.576
it would have to be from
the Millennium Eruption.

1571
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.953
The Millennium Eruption.

1572
01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:11.412
What the hell is that?

1573
01:44:11.496 --> 01:44:14.040
The Changbai volcano
on the border

1574
01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:17.710
of China and Korea
erupted in 946 A.D.

1575
01:44:17.794 --> 01:44:21.422
with the force of over
a thousand nuclear bombs.

1576
01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:23.132
It blew ash over half the world,

1577
01:44:23.216 --> 01:44:26.260
and today, you can still find
that ash buried in ice.

1578
01:44:26.344 --> 01:44:27.637
Is there any way to pinpoint

1579
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.514
exactly where in Russia
that ash would’ve landed?

1580
01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:31.140
-Laptop.

1581
01:44:33.059 --> 01:44:34.519
I love this kid.

1582
01:44:37.355 --> 01:44:39.065
Thanks.

1583
01:44:42.402 --> 01:44:44.153
Check this out.

1584
01:44:44.237 --> 01:44:46.072
This is the largest glacier
in Russia.

1585
01:44:46.155 --> 01:44:48.449
Scientists doing
deep drill experiments there

1586
01:44:48.533 --> 01:44:51.452
found volcanic ash
at a depth of 400 meters,

1587
01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:54.580
a depth consistent
with the average snowfall

1588
01:44:54.664 --> 01:44:57.000
since the year 946 A.D.

1589
01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:59.210
But to get ash
in the claws, I mean,

1590
01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:02.171
they would have to dig through
a thousand years of ice.

1591
01:45:03.423 --> 01:45:05.341
They didn’t dig down.
They dug up.

1592
01:45:05.425 --> 01:45:07.051
That’s why there’s
no sign of impact.

1593
01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:09.345
BOTH: They’ve been here
the whole time.

1594
01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:12.849
Why wait a thousand years
to dig out?

1595
01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:16.019
Martin, can you bring up an
ice melt projection for Russia?

1596
01:45:16.102 --> 01:45:20.231
Yeah, polar ice melt, uh,
Russia, 2023 to 2048.

1597
01:45:20.314 --> 01:45:21.482
MARTIN:
There it is.

1598
01:45:21.566 --> 01:45:22.817
CHARLIE:
They didn’t wait it out.

1599
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.069
They thawed out.

1600
01:45:28.281 --> 01:45:30.199
We have to get to Russia.

1601
01:45:30.283 --> 01:45:33.119
No. You’re not going to Russia.

1602
01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:35.663
-But that’s where they are.
-Well, we think.

1603
01:45:35.747 --> 01:45:37.832
No, we know.
That has to be where they are.

1604
01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:39.250
Have any proof?

1605
01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:40.793
We have to go there
to get the proof.

1606
01:45:40.877 --> 01:45:43.755
Listen, if we can go there now
and kill them all,

1607
01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:45.840
we prevent this from ever
happening, you understand?

1608
01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:48.176
We’ve lost all contact
with the future, Forester.

1609
01:45:48.259 --> 01:45:50.261
President just placed
the armed forces on high alert.

1610
01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.221
They’re rioting at the border.

1611
01:45:52.305 --> 01:45:54.849
Buenos Aires, Johannesburg,
Mexico City,

1612
01:45:54.932 --> 01:45:56.851
Istanbul, London.

1613
01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:58.561
NATO’s disbanded.

1614
01:45:58.644 --> 01:46:01.647
And-and you want me to use
taxpayer money

1615
01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:05.401
to fund a special covert mission
into a hostile sovereign nation,

1616
01:46:05.485 --> 01:46:07.487
led by a biology teacher?

1617
01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:10.239
Oh, also the head of R and D
for a tech company.

1618
01:46:10.323 --> 01:46:12.742
Wallace Technology-- we’re
the Amazon of earth sciences.

1619
01:46:12.825 --> 01:46:15.244
I can tell I’m not
convincing you at all. That’s...

1620
01:46:15.328 --> 01:46:18.039
Look, guys...

1621
01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:20.583
the way things are going,

1622
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:22.835
we’ll be lucky if we don’t
kill each other off

1623
01:46:22.919 --> 01:46:25.296
long before the aliens get here.

1624
01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:27.340
Excuse me.

1625
01:46:27.423 --> 01:46:29.550
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,

1626
01:46:29.634 --> 01:46:31.594
but people just hate
spending money on research.

1627
01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:34.013
I say we just go kill ’em
ourselves. How about that, huh?

1628
01:46:34.097 --> 01:46:35.640
No, Russia’s closed its borders.

1629
01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:37.809
I mean, we need a plane
and a pilot willing to commit

1630
01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:39.519
an international felony,
whatever that’s called.

1631
01:46:39.602 --> 01:46:41.938
There’s no way we can get there.

1632
01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:46.275
There may be a way.

1633
01:46:59.205 --> 01:47:01.124
So, how was the future?

1634
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.418
Miami Dolphins still suck?

1635
01:47:04.502 --> 01:47:06.462
I need a plane.

1636
01:47:06.546 --> 01:47:08.756
And a pilot.

1637
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.134
To fly undetected
into Russian airspace

1638
01:47:11.217 --> 01:47:15.096
so I can get a team of soldiers
to the top of a glacier island

1639
01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.181
in order to find...

1640
01:47:18.808 --> 01:47:20.810
...an alien spaceship.

1641
01:47:23.104 --> 01:47:25.106
Wow, you know,
they say kids never come by

1642
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:27.191
unless they need something.

1643
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:30.903
I need your help.

1644
01:47:33.531 --> 01:47:35.158
I’ll get my coat.

1645
01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:40.538
DAN:
Thank you for coming.

1646
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:44.417
Yeah. We made as much
of the toxin as we could.

1647
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.878
-I hope it’s enough.
-DAN: Me, too.

1648
01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:49.255
I worked with Colonel Forester.

1649
01:47:49.338 --> 01:47:51.299
She was your daughter, right?

1650
01:47:52.341 --> 01:47:53.634
Yeah.

1651
01:47:53.718 --> 01:47:56.012
It was an honor
to have known her.

1652
01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:02.310
HART:
And four.

1653
01:48:15.573 --> 01:48:17.533
Our man brought
the whole arsenal.

1654
01:48:17.617 --> 01:48:18.743
Yeah.

1655
01:48:18.826 --> 01:48:21.871
’Cause this time,
I’m not gonna hide.

1656
01:48:24.457 --> 01:48:25.583
I’m gonna fight.

1657
01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:27.251
It’s not even loaded.

1658
01:48:27.335 --> 01:48:28.711
CHARLIE:
It-it’s not loaded.

1659
01:48:28.794 --> 01:48:29.754
It’s a pressurized cabin.

1660
01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.380
Why would I load it
in the cabin?

1661
01:48:31.464 --> 01:48:33.424
A bullet goes in the thing,
and everybody’s sucked out.

1662
01:48:37.345 --> 01:48:39.722
HART:
Dropping to 1,000 feet.

1663
01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:43.351
CHARLIE: Okay, guys,
so we’re looking for, like,

1664
01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:44.769
geothermic anomalies, okay?

1665
01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:48.064
Anything weird,
like fissures, heat plumes

1666
01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:49.815
-or magnetic spikes.
-

1667
01:48:49.899 --> 01:48:53.236
Let’s grid up and cover this
part of the glacier by sundown.

1668
01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:55.988
HART: We’ll start with
the southeastern quadrant.

1669
01:49:14.048 --> 01:49:16.008
DAN:
We’ll gain a good vantage point

1670
01:49:16.092 --> 01:49:18.552
if we can get to the peak
of the ice cap before sundown.

1671
01:49:29.397 --> 01:49:31.482
JAMES: Might as well be
looking for an ice cube.

1672
01:49:35.444 --> 01:49:37.697
HART: Approaching
the northwestern quadrant.

1673
01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:41.200
Looks rough up ahead.
Watch your visibility.

1674
01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:03.472
Are your gauges acting up?

1675
01:50:03.556 --> 01:50:05.016
Yeah.

1676
01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:07.768
CHARLIE:
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1677
01:50:19.572 --> 01:50:21.699
Feel that?

1678
01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:24.285
Yeah, it’s like
something electrical.

1679
01:50:26.412 --> 01:50:28.039
Something.

1680
01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:36.589
DAN:
Whoa. Look at that.

1681
01:50:36.672 --> 01:50:39.216
We sitting on a magnetic field
or something?

1682
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.093
CHARLIE:
This is a giant block of ice.

1683
01:50:42.345 --> 01:50:44.263
Anything, like,
magnetically charged

1684
01:50:44.347 --> 01:50:46.640
would be at least
a thousand feet down.

1685
01:51:04.867 --> 01:51:07.453
I think we found your ice cube.

1686
01:51:07.536 --> 01:51:08.871
HART:
Going hot.

1687
01:51:15.086 --> 01:51:17.838
-Is that it?
-

1688
01:52:26.323 --> 01:52:28.325
-

1689
01:52:38.002 --> 01:52:42.173
JAMES: So you’re telling me
all this is melting in 30 years?

1690
01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:43.757
Well, one degree
is the difference

1691
01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:45.509
between ice and water.

1692
01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:42.983
DAN:
Okay, well...

1693
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:46.362
...at least we have proof.

1694
01:53:46.445 --> 01:53:49.448
We go in there, there’s
a chance we don’t come out.

1695
01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:52.034
We can leave right now.

1696
01:53:52.117 --> 01:53:54.161
Go back with photographs,

1697
01:53:54.245 --> 01:53:57.039
show everybody the world has
a common enemy to fight.

1698
01:53:57.122 --> 01:53:58.541
Absolutely.

1699
01:53:58.624 --> 01:54:00.209
Go tell the U.N.,

1700
01:54:00.292 --> 01:54:02.336
and they can talk about it
till we’re all dead.

1701
01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:06.131
Yeah. I mean, I hate to agree
with Conspiracy Santa,

1702
01:54:06.215 --> 01:54:08.634
but, you know, we get
the world governments involved,

1703
01:54:08.717 --> 01:54:10.636
it could turn into a nightmare.

1704
01:54:10.719 --> 01:54:12.263
Yeah.

1705
01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:14.139
I don’t have that kind of time.

1706
01:54:14.223 --> 01:54:15.683
Neither does Muri.

1707
01:54:15.766 --> 01:54:18.102
Feel like this is
my opportunity to give her

1708
01:54:18.185 --> 01:54:20.437
and give this world
a second chance.

1709
01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:25.526
Second chances are
really hard to come by.

1710
01:54:34.994 --> 01:54:36.954
So, what are we gonna do?

1711
01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:39.248
I guess we’re gonna cut
that son of a bitch open

1712
01:54:39.331 --> 01:54:41.584
and shoot anything
that looks sideways at us.

1713
01:54:51.176 --> 01:54:53.095
DAN:
Guys.

1714
01:54:53.178 --> 01:54:55.097
You’re secondary perimeter.

1715
01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:57.433
If we don’t come out
and something else does,

1716
01:54:57.516 --> 01:54:58.934
it cannot leave this cave.

1717
01:54:59.018 --> 01:55:00.227
You understand?

1718
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:02.980
Roger that.

1719
01:55:03.063 --> 01:55:04.648
Good luck.

1720
01:55:59.912 --> 01:56:03.040
Looks like we found our cockpit.

1721
01:56:05.918 --> 01:56:08.420
Those aren’t Whitespikes.

1722
01:56:10.047 --> 01:56:12.591
DAN:
They most certainly are not.

1723
01:56:13.842 --> 01:56:16.303
They didn’t want to land here.
This is a crash site.

1724
01:56:17.346 --> 01:56:19.139
Let’s move.

1725
01:56:56.135 --> 01:56:57.970
HART:
The Whitespikes.

1726
01:56:58.053 --> 01:57:01.056
They’re cargo.

1727
01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.058
Ready to breed, like cattle.

1728
01:57:03.142 --> 01:57:05.436
Or weapons.

1729
01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:08.689
Uh, planet-clearing weapons?

1730
01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:11.150
Yeah, but they crashed.

1731
01:57:12.568 --> 01:57:14.361
Who’s to say
Earth was their target?

1732
01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:16.947
It doesn’t matter.

1733
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:18.490
When we’re done with them,
it’ll be like

1734
01:57:18.574 --> 01:57:19.742
they were never here at all.

1735
01:57:19.825 --> 01:57:21.577
Let’s go.

1736
01:58:09.958 --> 01:58:11.794
She did it.

1737
01:58:16.423 --> 01:58:18.801
Ikemba!

1738
01:58:18.884 --> 01:58:20.302
Go! Get ’em! Dose ’em!

1739
01:58:20.385 --> 01:58:22.304
HART:
Take the corner.

1740
01:58:41.782 --> 01:58:44.201
Charlie, James,
we got Whitespikes on the move!

1741
01:58:44.284 --> 01:58:45.869
-JAMES: Shit.

1742
01:58:45.953 --> 01:58:47.621
I got the entrance covered.

1743
01:58:47.704 --> 01:58:50.249
Go! We’ll get the ones
in the ship.

1744
01:58:50.332 --> 01:58:52.167
DORIAN: Give me that C-4. In
case one of us gets in trouble,

1745
01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:54.711
we got to blow this thing
manually, all right?

1746
01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:56.088
-No timers.
-No, no, no, no.

1747
01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:57.256
Take this.

1748
01:58:57.339 --> 01:58:59.383
As a souvenir.

1749
01:59:02.302 --> 01:59:04.596
Go save your daughter.

1750
01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:10.727
HART:
Let’s go!

1751
01:59:10.811 --> 01:59:12.187
JAMES:
I go left. You go right.

1752
01:59:12.271 --> 01:59:14.815
CHARLIE: We got this.
No one’s hiding today.

1753
01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:16.900
-Whoops.

1754
01:59:16.984 --> 01:59:18.569
JAMES:
Oops?

1755
01:59:18.652 --> 01:59:19.736
Uh-oh.

1756
01:59:21.071 --> 01:59:23.323
Shit. Charlie.

1757
01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:26.118
Charlie.

1758
01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:27.703
Charlie, I need you!

1759
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:30.706
Charlie! Charlie!

1760
01:59:30.789 --> 01:59:31.915
-Charlie!

1761
01:59:45.012 --> 01:59:47.014
Charlie? Dad?

1762
01:59:52.311 --> 01:59:53.478
DORIAN
I got contact!

1763
01:59:53.562 --> 01:59:55.230
Light ’em up!

1764
01:59:58.025 --> 01:59:59.610
They’re on the move!

1765
01:59:59.693 --> 02:00:01.194
Light ’em up! Fire!

1766
02:00:10.579 --> 02:00:12.289
HART
Holy shit.

1767
02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:14.291
There’s a whole colony
down here.

1768
02:00:14.374 --> 02:00:15.751
We got to blow the ship!

1769
02:00:19.254 --> 02:00:20.589
HART:
I’ll hold them off.

1770
02:00:23.842 --> 02:00:25.969
HART
Blow the ship!

1771
02:00:26.053 --> 02:00:27.220
If I’m gonna die...

1772
02:00:30.557 --> 02:00:33.769
...I’m gonna die my way!

1773
02:00:52.287 --> 02:00:54.998
Dad? Charlie?

1774
02:00:55.082 --> 02:00:56.875
You all right?

1775
02:00:56.959 --> 02:00:58.210
You okay?

1776
02:00:58.293 --> 02:00:59.461
I got one!

1777
02:00:59.544 --> 02:01:00.837
JAMES
Yeah, you did.

1778
02:01:00.921 --> 02:01:03.006
He sliced it up
like Julia Child.

1779
02:01:03.090 --> 02:01:04.716
One got away, though.

1780
02:01:05.759 --> 02:01:07.886
Big one. Red belly.

1781
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:09.388
Oh, shit.

1782
02:01:09.471 --> 02:01:10.931
That’s the female.

1783
02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:12.724
We better go get her

1784
02:01:12.808 --> 02:01:16.186
before she lays an egg
or whatever the hell they do.

1785
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:24.569
Come on, look at you.
Your hands are shaking.

1786
02:01:24.653 --> 02:01:25.946
I’m fine.

1787
02:01:26.029 --> 02:01:27.781
No, you’re gonna be
a liability out there.

1788
02:01:27.864 --> 02:01:29.866
I need you to stay here,
stay with Charlie.

1789
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:31.785
You don’t have to babysit me.

1790
02:01:31.868 --> 02:01:33.912
This is the one thing
I’m good at.

1791
02:01:40.127 --> 02:01:43.547
DAN: Aim for the left ridge.
Mind the horizon.

1792
02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:45.549
We only get one shot at this.

1793
02:02:03.859 --> 02:02:05.861
JAMES:
Dan.

1794
02:02:05.944 --> 02:02:08.363
I found something.
I got tracks here.

1795
02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:11.491
DAN:
Dad, she’s on the move.

1796
02:02:13.827 --> 02:02:15.704
Dad, Dad, do you copy?

1797
02:02:24.004 --> 02:02:26.339
-

1798
02:02:26.423 --> 02:02:28.759
Surprise, dumbass.

1799
02:02:53.909 --> 02:02:55.410
-Move!
-Moving.

1800
02:03:02.918 --> 02:03:04.503
-Yeah, she didn’t like that.
-Get her!

1801
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:24.356
Where the hell is she?

1802
02:03:28.026 --> 02:03:29.653
Goddamn it.

1803
02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.491
You stuck her, Dad.

1804
02:03:35.534 --> 02:03:36.910
Back-to-back.

1805
02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:45.794
JAMES:
Got eyes on her?

1806
02:03:45.877 --> 02:03:47.420
DAN:
No.

1807
02:03:49.756 --> 02:03:51.007
She’s bleeding, though.

1808
02:03:51.091 --> 02:03:52.801
JAMES:
Maybe she’s down.

1809
02:03:52.884 --> 02:03:55.053
DAN:
No, she ain’t down.

1810
02:03:56.555 --> 02:03:58.515
You stuck her, though.
You got her, Dad.

1811
02:04:13.071 --> 02:04:15.991
-

1812
02:05:18.511 --> 02:05:20.430
Come here.

1813
02:05:23.308 --> 02:05:24.684
JAMES:
Hey.

1814
02:05:31.066 --> 02:05:32.567
I’m sorry, son.

1815
02:05:32.651 --> 02:05:33.860
No.

1816
02:05:33.944 --> 02:05:36.613
-No, no, no, Dad.
-I’m sorry for...

1817
02:05:36.696 --> 02:05:37.864
everything.

1818
02:06:19.447 --> 02:06:21.199
Die!

1819
02:06:22.742 --> 02:06:23.952
Die!

1820
02:06:53.023 --> 02:06:55.317
Did you tell it to die?

1821
02:06:56.359 --> 02:06:57.694
Yeah.

1822
02:06:59.696 --> 02:07:01.364
It worked.

1823
02:07:03.783 --> 02:07:05.785
Why didn’t you tell it sooner?

1824
02:07:12.542 --> 02:07:14.294
Yeah.

1825
02:07:14.377 --> 02:07:16.546
Let’s just take a little break.

1826
02:07:26.097 --> 02:07:27.766
REPORTER: Some incredible
images coming out

1827
02:07:27.849 --> 02:07:29.476
-of Russia today. -REPORTER 2:
That’s right, Gabrielle.

1828
02:07:29.559 --> 02:07:31.519
An explosion rocked
a glacier there,

1829
02:07:31.603 --> 02:07:33.480
and top government sources
are saying that it has

1830
02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:35.940
something to do with the aliens
and the future war.

1831
02:07:36.024 --> 02:07:37.400
As soon as I heard that

1832
02:07:37.484 --> 02:07:39.152
the Whitespikes might
already be here,

1833
02:07:39.235 --> 02:07:40.987
my actions were swift
and decisive.

1834
02:07:41.071 --> 02:07:43.573
A coalition of elite soldiers
under my sole command

1835
02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:45.575
eliminated the future
alien threat.

1836
02:07:45.658 --> 02:07:47.160
And you know what?

1837
02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:48.536
I’d do it again.

1838
02:07:55.502 --> 02:07:57.128
Dad!

1839
02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:05.887
EMMY:
I love you.

1840
02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:07.180
Hey.

1841
02:08:07.263 --> 02:08:08.515
You found them?

1842
02:08:08.598 --> 02:08:10.600
Yeah.

1843
02:08:10.683 --> 02:08:12.727
Yeah, we found ’em.

1844
02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:14.145
Hey.

1845
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:16.314
Chickpea...

1846
02:08:16.398 --> 02:08:18.483
I’d like you to meet
your grandpa.

1847
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:35.250
DAN: I never told her about
our seven days together

1848
02:08:35.333 --> 02:08:39.212
nor how, in a future
that now will never happen,

1849
02:08:39.295 --> 02:08:42.298
she changed me forever.

1850
02:08:42.382 --> 02:08:45.260
I’m never gonna leave her.

1851
02:08:45.343 --> 02:08:48.555
I’ll never leave this family.

1852
02:08:48.638 --> 02:08:53.268
Because my best future,
it turned out,

1853
02:08:53.351 --> 02:09:55.687
