00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.074





2
00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:56.623
Obviously,
I miscalculated a few things.

3
00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:07.634
Eddie! I know you're in there!

4
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:16.851
Why is it that the moment your life
exceeds your wildest dreams...

5
00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:18.478
The access code you have entered...

6
00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.855
...the knife appears at your back?

7
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.234
The access code
you have entered is invalid...

8
00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:27.737
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

9
00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:52.345
...I will never let them touch me.

10
00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.069
My neighbor, who must have
opened his door to complain.

11
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:11.656
- You're gonna be next, Eddie!
- We're coming in!

12
00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:17.495
For a guy with a four digit IQ,
I must have missed something.

13
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.456
And I hadn't missed much.

14
00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.418
I'd come this close to having
an impact on the world.

15
00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:27.338
And now, the only thing
I'd have an impact on...

16
00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:30.133
...was the sidewalk.

17
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:53.800
You see that guy?

18
00:03:53.884 --> 00:03:55.885
That was me, not so long ago.

19
00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:59.889
What kind of guy without a drug or
alcohol problem looks this way?

20
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.684
Only a writer. Strangely enough,

21
00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:05.436
nobody believed that
I actually had a book contract.

22
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:07.230
Well, it's masquerading
as a sci-fi novel,

23
00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:08.982
but it's really, uh,
my own personal manifesto

24
00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.984
about the plight of the
individual in the 21st century.

25
00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:13.319
I sort of created a utopian society

26
00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:15.613
where we all sort of...
Uh... Uh...

27
00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:18.408
It's really... it's really...

28
00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:23.163
Uh...

29
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.668
Today was the day
I was gonna kick its ass.

30
00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:31.754
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go...

31
00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:34.924
It was gonna be great.

32
00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.219
Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.

33
00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.014
That's the key concept.

34
00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.559
Don't leave the room.

35
00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:54.611
A few weeks passed this way.

36
00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:56.070
Maybe a few months.

37
00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:03.666
At least I still had Lindy.

38
00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.054
Just like that?

39
00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:12.768
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.

40
00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:15.270
I'm surprised.

41
00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:18.524
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...

42
00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:20.317
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.

43
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:21.860
If you just wait to see
what she says...

44
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:23.153
Eddie.

45
00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:25.447
- What?
- I know how it's going.

46
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:27.282
I'm your...

47
00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:30.327
I was your girlfriend.

48
00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:33.830
That word doesn't even begin
to describe what you are to me.

49
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:37.292
Partner? Squeeze?

50
00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:40.254
Paramour. Inamorata.

51
00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:43.549
Cleaning lady. Bank.

52
00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.094
Thanks. Be right back.

53
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.470
Be that a...

54
00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:50.847
What's mine is yours, too,

55
00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:53.350
and you know I want to share
the rest of my life with you.

56
00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.602
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.

57
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:57.521
Why not?

58
00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:01.650
Because it worked out
so well for you last time.

59
00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:04.861
- It's true, I did marry once.
- Right out of college, to Melissa.

60
00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:06.530
I do.

61
00:06:06.614 --> 00:06:07.614
Briefly.

62
00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.491
This isn't working.

63
00:06:14.497 --> 00:06:16.832
Well, even though everything you
say is true, I still love you.

64
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:24.715
I gotta get back to work.

65
00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:28.927
You didn't even
tell me what happened.

66
00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.346
- I got it.
- You did?

67
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.724
Mm-hm. I'm an editor.

68
00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:36.226
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?

69
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:38.937
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.

70
00:06:41.357 --> 00:06:42.482
Thanks.

71
00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:46.987
- OK.
- OK.

72
00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:56.663
She was right. Why stick it out?

73
00:06:57.498 --> 00:06:59.625
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.

74
00:07:00.293 --> 00:07:02.085
We both knew what was beckoning.

75
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.422
The lower bunk in my
childhood bedroom in Jersey.

76
00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:08.091
My father happy to welcome me
into the challenging field

77
00:07:08.176 --> 00:07:10.260
of dental supply inventory.

78
00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:12.095
Eddie Morra.

79
00:07:14.182 --> 00:07:16.433
Of all the useless
relationships better forgotten

80
00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:18.060
and put away in mothballs,

81
00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:21.104
is there any more useless than...
the ex-brother-in-law?

82
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.440
Holy shit, man.

83
00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:25.442
What has it been? Like nine years?

84
00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:26.777
- God!
- Hey.

85
00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:30.447
You all right? You look like
you're living on the streets.

86
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:31.531
What's going on?

87
00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:34.743
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?

88
00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:36.912
Uh, I'm writing. Writing a lot.

89
00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:38.622
Oh, you're still trying to write?

90
00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:40.916
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.

91
00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:42.793
- Really?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:44.378
- That's great.
- How about you?

93
00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:45.879
Are you still dealing, Vern?

94
00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:49.257
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.

95
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.593
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.

96
00:07:52.387 --> 00:07:54.596
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

97
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:58.141
When has that ever stopped you?

98
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:02.979
- So.
- So...

99
00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:04.690
How's Melissa doing?

100
00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:06.441
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

101
00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:10.654
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.

102
00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:15.325
She got some kind of Internet home sales
kind of job. Couple kids.

103
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.370
Couple kids. Who's the husband?

104
00:08:19.372 --> 00:08:22.958
He walked out on her,
if you really want to know.

105
00:08:23.042 --> 00:08:24.459
But what do you care, man?

106
00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:27.713
You were married, like, five minutes.

107
00:08:27.797 --> 00:08:30.716
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?

108
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.593
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?

109
00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:36.847
Well, it's, uh...

110
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:38.306
I'm... I'm...

111
00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:41.226
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.

112
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.564
And, uh, it's pretty well
polluting my days and nights,
if you really want to know.

113
00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:49.109
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.

114
00:08:49.193 --> 00:08:52.612
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

115
00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:58.493
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.

116
00:08:58.578 --> 00:09:00.287
Just this once.

117
00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:02.914
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

118
00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:06.501
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.

119
00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:09.171
Brother,
I am light years from that now.

120
00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:13.383
I've been doing, uh, some consulting
for a pharmaceutical company.

121
00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:16.219
What, like some offshore lab
making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.

122
00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:21.141
No. This is an exclusive product
that's coming on stream next year.

123
00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:24.102
They've had clinical trials
and it's FDA approved.

124
00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:27.105
All right, just out of curiosity
and that's all...

125
00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.442
Let's see it.

126
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:34.571
What's in it?

127
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.491
They've identified these receptors
in the brain

128
00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:40.368
that activate specific circuits.

129
00:09:40.453 --> 00:09:44.122
And you how they say that we can
only access 20 percent of our brain?

130
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.294
Well, what this does...
it lets you access all of it.

131
00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:53.924
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.

132
00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:56.551
I don't think that my life's
gonna take some sudden upswing

133
00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:59.888
- into fame and fortune by taking some
shiny, brand-new designer drug.

134
00:09:59.972 --> 00:10:03.058
Gant. When?

135
00:10:03.142 --> 00:10:07.187
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.

136
00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:10.232
No, now.

137
00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:15.445
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to leave you here, Eddie.

138
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.198
But I really... I really do
want to do this again.

139
00:10:18.282 --> 00:10:21.576
So, call me.
And, uh, that's on the house.

140
00:10:22.453 --> 00:10:23.870
I don't want it.

141
00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:27.165
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?

142
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.876
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.

143
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.128
You're welcome.

144
00:10:43.683 --> 00:10:45.725
All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.

145
00:10:46.477 --> 00:10:49.145
How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.

146
00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:53.108
Smarter than anyone around her.

147
00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:55.569
Clearly, there was a direct link
between this Eddie,

148
00:10:55.653 --> 00:10:58.738
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon,
and an earlier Eddie...

149
00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:02.868
...vomiting on his boss's desk
or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.

150
00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:07.622
So who could blame Lindy
for dumping me?

151
00:11:16.507 --> 00:11:19.593
In the end, how much worse could it get?

152
00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:29.978
I didn't want to see anybody.

153
00:11:30.062 --> 00:11:32.898
Especially not my landlord's
nasty young wife.

154
00:11:32.982 --> 00:11:35.317
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?

155
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.694
Steve handles the rent,
so you can feed your crap to him.

156
00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:39.696
I suddenly had extra reason
to get away from her.

157
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.532
I had thoughtlessly ingested
a substance.

158
00:11:42.617 --> 00:11:44.034
Like the rent's not low enough!

159
00:11:44.118 --> 00:11:46.786
I had gotten remarkably
little information from Vernon

160
00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.580
about what this drug would do.

161
00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:52.250
You could even be a bike messenger
and come up with that. Really.

162
00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:54.628
- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic.

163
00:11:54.712 --> 00:11:58.840
Oh, my God. Listening
to her rag... If I were tripping,
I'd jump out a window.

164
00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:01.051
Hello? Are you listening to me?

165
00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:04.179
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!

166
00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:06.014
And then, I felt it.

167
00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.255
I was blind, but now I see.

168
00:12:54.313 --> 00:12:56.856
...Running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?

169
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:59.150
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!

170
00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:02.612
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!

171
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.084
- What's wrong?
- What?

172
00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:18.628
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating,

173
00:13:18.713 --> 00:13:21.423
energy-sucking piece of shit
who's sponging off your husband.

174
00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:22.841
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out,

175
00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:25.844
but my existence shouldn't make you
this upset. What is it?

176
00:13:26.846 --> 00:13:29.556
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?

177
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.016
How do you know I'm in law school?

178
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.726
People who aren't, usually
don't carry around dry,

179
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.353
academically-constipated books
about a dead Supreme Court justice.

180
00:13:36.063 --> 00:13:38.398
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... You've been following me.

181
00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:41.526
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.

182
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.986
How did you know that?

183
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.156
- I'd seen it before.
- Twelve years ago in college.

184
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.491
Sitting on the couch of a TA
I was trying to make,

185
00:13:48.576 --> 00:13:50.326
waiting for her to come
back out of the bathroom,

186
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:52.370
hoping she'd have a condom.

187
00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:54.998
Somehow my unconscious
had served that up.

188
00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:56.624
A memory I had never even recorded.

189
00:13:56.709 --> 00:14:00.420
Or was it there the whole time
and all I needed was the access?

190
00:14:00.504 --> 00:14:02.630
If you're writing a paper,
that's not the book I'd use.

191
00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:04.507
Well, who asked you?

192
00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:06.509
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.

193
00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:08.678
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

194
00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:10.096
which sort of gives credence
to the theory

195
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:11.181
that one of the clerks he had fired

196
00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:13.391
actually wrote most of
this guy's major opinions.

197
00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:15.810
You could Google the clerk's sons,
they'd love to talk to you.

198
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:18.563
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you
something that no one else has...

199
00:14:18.647 --> 00:14:21.399
Information from the odd
museum show, a half-read article,

200
00:14:21.484 --> 00:14:24.527
some PBS documentary... it was all
bubbling up in my frontal lobes,

201
00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:28.031
mixing itself together into a sparkling
cocktail of useful information.

202
00:14:30.117 --> 00:14:32.952
- She didn't have a chance.
- So, what are your suggestions?

203
00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:40.043
We'd really worked
on her paper, too.

204
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:44.464
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.

205
00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:54.474
Home. But it couldn't be my home,
could it?

206
00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:56.768
Who would live like this?

207
00:14:58.395 --> 00:15:01.356
Torch it.

208
00:15:02.024 --> 00:15:03.650
But saner heads prevailed.

209
00:15:39.103 --> 00:15:41.437
- What was this drug?
- I couldn't stay messy on it,

210
00:15:41.522 --> 00:15:46.359
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours,
hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?

211
00:15:46.443 --> 00:15:49.904
What was this? A drug for people who
wanted to be more anal retentive?

212
00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:52.782
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.

213
00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:55.368
I knew what I needed to do
and how to do it.

214
00:16:33.157 --> 00:16:38.578
The next morning, I sent
a little probe down into my brain.

215
00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:42.248
No surge of brilliance
came up to greet me.

216
00:16:45.628 --> 00:16:48.880
In short... I was back.

217
00:16:53.552 --> 00:16:55.470
But, something remained.

218
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600
You're kidding.

219
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.687
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.

220
00:17:04.772 --> 00:17:07.732
- Yes.
- Written by you.

221
00:17:07.816 --> 00:17:09.192
All you have to do is read three pages.

222
00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:12.362
Just read three pages
in the next hour and...

223
00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:14.989
...if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.

224
00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.119
OK.

225
00:17:21.497 --> 00:17:23.706
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.

226
00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:52.652
Eddie,
give me a call when you get in.

227
00:17:54.738 --> 00:17:59.367
- Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
- Call me.

228
00:17:59.451 --> 00:18:02.578
It's a little grandiose,
but I'm still reading.

229
00:18:02.663 --> 00:18:06.416
OK, how did you do this?

230
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.671
I'd really like... Just call me
the minute you get in. Call. OK?

231
00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:30.940
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.

232
00:18:31.025 --> 00:18:35.528
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra.

233
00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:39.949
It's not a good time, Eddie.

234
00:18:40.034 --> 00:18:43.202
Uh, hey, Vern, I really
just need to talk to you.

235
00:18:44.663 --> 00:18:46.372
Hey... Oh...

236
00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:53.046
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

237
00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:57.008
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.

238
00:18:57.092 --> 00:19:00.678
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.

239
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.389
Vern, who did this to you?

240
00:19:03.932 --> 00:19:05.391
Trust me, you don't want to know.

241
00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:09.812
Uh...

242
00:19:09.897 --> 00:19:13.941
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.

243
00:19:14.026 --> 00:19:17.820
But the boys in the kitchen
are calling it NZT 48.

244
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:21.115
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...

245
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.577
That doesn't sound
very FDA-approved, Vern.

246
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:29.332
FDA-approved, that's a laugh. You didn't
really believe that shit, did ya?

247
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:32.335
OK, so what do we have here?

248
00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:35.588
Some unknown, untested,
possibly dangerous drug

249
00:19:35.672 --> 00:19:38.007
scammed out of some
unidentified lab somewhere

250
00:19:38.092 --> 00:19:42.470
given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years.

251
00:19:42.554 --> 00:19:45.431
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.

252
00:19:47.434 --> 00:19:51.354
All right, we'll talk about it,
but I, uh, need a favor first.

253
00:19:51.438 --> 00:19:54.649
Obviously, I'm in no condition
to go out right now, so,

254
00:19:54.733 --> 00:20:00.363
I was wondering if you could pop down to
the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.

255
00:20:00.447 --> 00:20:04.826
And maybe grab a little...
a little breakfast for us.

256
00:20:06.787 --> 00:20:08.079
He knew he had me.

257
00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:09.831
Sure.

258
00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:14.752
From now on,
I'd happily be his errand boy.

259
00:20:14.837 --> 00:20:18.131
Wash his windows,
scrub his toilet...

260
00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.967
...anything I could do to get my hands
on that little clear pill

261
00:20:21.051 --> 00:20:24.137
that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.

262
00:20:35.607 --> 00:20:37.207
Vern?

263
00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:13.102
Vern...

264
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:17.857
Oh, Vern.

265
00:21:40.005 --> 00:21:42.298
Hey, hey!

266
00:21:43.008 --> 00:21:44.508
Hey!

267
00:21:56.021 --> 00:22:00.483
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, I need to report a...

268
00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:02.026
...a murder.

269
00:22:05.322 --> 00:22:06.948
7B, yes.

270
00:22:09.743 --> 00:22:11.244
OK, I won't.

271
00:22:13.747 --> 00:22:18.334
Took them forever. And the longer
I stood there, the clearer I saw.

272
00:22:18.418 --> 00:22:20.544
Vern had known whoever had done this.

273
00:22:21.797 --> 00:22:24.465
And one guess what
they'd been looking for.

274
00:22:29.054 --> 00:22:30.805
But had they found it?

275
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.347
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.

276
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:50.676
- Police Department!
- Open the door, please!

277
00:23:53.221 --> 00:23:56.098
Police Department! Open the door!

278
00:24:00.187 --> 00:24:04.565
Open the door, please!

279
00:24:05.984 --> 00:24:08.110
Police! Open the door!

280
00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:11.113
Let's go! Open the door!

281
00:24:11.198 --> 00:24:12.490
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.

282
00:24:12.574 --> 00:24:14.533
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!

283
00:24:14.618 --> 00:24:16.035
I called you guys!

284
00:24:19.164 --> 00:24:21.957
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?

285
00:24:22.042 --> 00:24:25.836
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just
actually ran into him on the street

286
00:24:25.921 --> 00:24:28.464
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?

287
00:24:28.548 --> 00:24:32.426
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?

288
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:35.805
He... Uh, I don't know. He was, um...

289
00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:38.307
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?

290
00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:42.228
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques. Um...

291
00:24:42.312 --> 00:24:45.398
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...

292
00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:48.192
...chairs and stuff.

293
00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:50.986
Like, you know,
like curlicue leg things.

294
00:24:51.071 --> 00:24:52.154
Yeah?

295
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.200
That is correct. An Edward Morra.

296
00:24:56.284 --> 00:24:57.618
He's here.

297
00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:00.246
Victim's sister.

298
00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:03.833
I hadn't heard her voice
in ten years.

299
00:25:04.584 --> 00:25:07.294
- Eddie?
- Melissa?

300
00:25:08.004 --> 00:25:10.923
- You were there?
- Um...

301
00:25:11.007 --> 00:25:16.095
Just before. I had run into him
on the street and, uh... yeah.

302
00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:21.392
Oh, God.
I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff.

303
00:25:22.227 --> 00:25:23.686
I'd better not say any more.

304
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.939
No, no, that's probably a good idea.

305
00:25:27.023 --> 00:25:31.569
So, uh... We should probably, uh,
meet or something, right?

306
00:25:31.653 --> 00:25:36.365
No, I gotta do the funeral
and God knows what else. I just...

307
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.659
We can't meet, OK?

308
00:25:38.743 --> 00:25:41.078
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll
just see you at the funeral then.

309
00:25:41.163 --> 00:25:44.498
No. I don't want that. Please
don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?

310
00:25:44.583 --> 00:25:47.585
- When this is over.
- OK, all right.

311
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:48.878
OK.

312
00:25:53.508 --> 00:25:58.053
You know, something doesn't gel here.

313
00:25:58.138 --> 00:26:01.765
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.

314
00:26:33.457 --> 00:26:35.875
Worth the risk?

315
00:26:41.215 --> 00:26:43.133
What would you do?

316
00:27:13.247 --> 00:27:17.417
Vern's cash, combined with
an unprecedented surge of motivation,

317
00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:20.295
enabled me to finish the book
in four days.

318
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.348
A tablet a day

319
00:27:32.433 --> 00:27:34.851
and what I could do
with my day was limitless.

320
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.313
I learned to play
the piano in three days.

321
00:27:40.649 --> 00:27:42.192
Math became useful.

322
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.194
And fun.

323
00:27:44.278 --> 00:27:45.862
I'm all in.

324
00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:53.119
Even half-listening
to any language, I became fluent.

325
00:28:00.628 --> 00:28:03.129
So that Shakespeare's catchiness
belies mediocrity?

326
00:28:03.964 --> 00:28:04.964
There's no arguing with you.

327
00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:09.052
This was great.

328
00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:11.888
So, Mom, I've been doing a little
research on Aunt Helen's tumor.

329
00:28:11.972 --> 00:28:15.517
And it's totally clear that anybody with
familial adenomatous polyposis

330
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:17.811
should be supplementing
platinum-based doublet regiments

331
00:28:17.895 --> 00:28:19.270
with eicosapentaeonic acid.

332
00:28:19.355 --> 00:28:21.898
- I suddenly knew everything.
- About everything.

333
00:28:22.182 --> 00:28:24.684
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

334
00:28:24.768 --> 00:28:26.269
devalue that stock completely
in two years?

335
00:28:26.353 --> 00:28:28.896
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?

336
00:28:28.981 --> 00:28:31.274
There aren't. Because there are
no safeguards in human nature.

337
00:28:31.358 --> 00:28:32.900
We're wired to overreach.

338
00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:35.194
Look at history, all the countries
that ever ruled the world.

339
00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.779
Portugal with this big massive navy.

340
00:28:36.864 --> 00:28:38.614
All they got now are salt cod
and cheap condoms.

341
00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:39.699
And the Brits?

342
00:28:39.783 --> 00:28:41.868
Now they're just sitting on a dank
little island fussing over their suits.

343
00:28:41.952 --> 00:28:43.619
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well."

344
00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:46.122
We got France, we got Poland,
we got a big Swiss bank account.

345
00:28:46.206 --> 00:28:47.874
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.

346
00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:50.752
"Let's go home, let's pop a beer,
and let's live off the interest."

347
00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:52.253
Yeah.

348
00:28:53.088 --> 00:28:54.672
My brain was just
pouring this stuff out.

349
00:28:54.757 --> 00:28:58.468
Everything I had ever read, heard,
seen was now organized and available.

350
00:28:58.552 --> 00:29:00.595
Here it is. Here you go.

351
00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:03.473
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio,

352
00:29:03.557 --> 00:29:06.768
but if you don't, I'd be very
interested in working with you.

353
00:29:06.852 --> 00:29:09.228
OK, Kevin.

354
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.523
I made some new friends
who invited me to the beach.

355
00:29:12.608 --> 00:29:14.942
The beach was not nearby.

356
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.999
All my fear,
all my shyness, gone.

357
00:29:30.084 --> 00:29:31.959
They've done four basic trials...

358
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.463
But mere lounging wasn't enough.

359
00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:03.658
- Only problem?
- If I wasn't moving forward,

360
00:30:03.742 --> 00:30:05.993
I felt like I was going to explode.

361
00:30:06.078 --> 00:30:08.204
Come up here because
it's beautiful, right?

362
00:30:08.288 --> 00:30:11.165
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?

363
00:30:15.629 --> 00:30:17.588
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

364
00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:20.675
Oh, my God!

365
00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:34.355
Oh!

366
00:30:36.066 --> 00:30:37.233
Ah!

367
00:30:37.317 --> 00:30:41.362
And then I began to form an idea.

368
00:30:41.446 --> 00:30:43.865
Suddenly, I knew exactly
what I needed to do.

369
00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:46.534
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.

370
00:30:46.618 --> 00:30:48.661
It was much bigger than that.

371
00:30:51.415 --> 00:30:53.291
But it would take money to get there.

372
00:30:56.253 --> 00:30:58.838
In a down market,
no one was making much.

373
00:31:00.007 --> 00:31:02.341
But no one had NZT.

374
00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:05.553
In an
optimistic scenario, gains of
that nature merely would reflect

375
00:31:05.637 --> 00:31:08.514
growth in the economy
and would not pose an obstacle...

376
00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:20.359
Armed with Vern's last $800,
I made 2,000 in a day.

377
00:31:20.444 --> 00:31:22.778
Next day, 7,500.

378
00:31:22.863 --> 00:31:26.240
It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.

379
00:31:26.992 --> 00:31:29.285
But banks weren't lending
to guys like me.

380
00:31:29.369 --> 00:31:30.328
Hey, Liev.

381
00:31:30.412 --> 00:31:32.914
That's your man
in the corner back there.

382
00:31:37.044 --> 00:31:38.252
Yeah.

383
00:31:46.386 --> 00:31:51.098
So, uh, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?

384
00:31:51.183 --> 00:31:53.059
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.

385
00:31:53.644 --> 00:31:54.644
Why?

386
00:31:54.728 --> 00:31:58.814
Because I don't see you before
and I don't like you already.

387
00:31:58.899 --> 00:32:01.234
Why do I give you $100,000?

388
00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:03.486
Because...

389
00:32:05.364 --> 00:32:08.449
...I quintupled my money
four days in a row.

390
00:32:08.533 --> 00:32:10.493
So you got a fix on the game.

391
00:32:10.577 --> 00:32:12.328
No, not a fix.

392
00:32:13.212 --> 00:32:15.589
I was able to calculate certain patterns
using algorithms.

393
00:32:15.673 --> 00:32:18.091
If you look at column four,
this was the first...

394
00:32:20.511 --> 00:32:23.555
You're good.

395
00:32:26.142 --> 00:32:27.309
OK, it's a fix.

396
00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:30.270
Yeah, you know,
all you people get caught.

397
00:32:30.354 --> 00:32:31.646
What are you gonna do then?

398
00:32:32.482 --> 00:32:34.941
Well, it's not as if I have
a black book with your name in it,

399
00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:36.818
if that's what you're talking about.

400
00:32:36.903 --> 00:32:39.154
And besides, I get the strong feeling

401
00:32:39.238 --> 00:32:42.074
that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.

402
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:48.705
- Don't get up.
- I said don't get up.

403
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.123
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.

404
00:32:52.126 --> 00:32:55.337
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.

405
00:32:55.421 --> 00:32:59.049
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?

406
00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:01.176
I cut you at waist.

407
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.013
Peel your skin up over your head
and tie knot in it.

408
00:33:05.097 --> 00:33:07.516
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.

409
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.935
- OK.
- Good luck.

410
00:33:17.902 --> 00:33:20.695
My new friend, Kevin Doyle,
showed me how you could leverage

411
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.699
two and a half times your cash
at the day trading firm.

412
00:33:24.784 --> 00:33:26.618
I'd been upping the dose
for over a week.

413
00:33:28.913 --> 00:33:31.498
It seemed to cut my learning curve.

414
00:33:45.972 --> 00:33:48.765
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.

415
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.685
But not for the big fat defense contract
he bribed his way into.

416
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:54.187
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.

417
00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:57.148
I was jacked in. Booted up.

418
00:33:57.233 --> 00:33:59.025
At the end of the week,
my brokerage account

419
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.152
contained over two million dollars.

420
00:34:02.154 --> 00:34:04.072
Word quickly got out.

421
00:34:09.954 --> 00:34:12.914
You have 19 messages.

422
00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:15.500
Four job offers,
my bank raising my line of credit,

423
00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:17.252
a reporter from the New York Post.

424
00:34:17.336 --> 00:34:19.254
Really call me back, Mr. Morra.

425
00:34:19.338 --> 00:34:20.755
No one makes money that fast.

426
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.300
This article's gonna get written
with or without you.

427
00:34:23.384 --> 00:34:26.511
And finally,
Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.

428
00:34:26.596 --> 00:34:31.016
Eddie, I was talking
you up to my boss and, well,
the impossible happened, bud.

429
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.935
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.

430
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.479
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

431
00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:40.233
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.

432
00:34:40.318 --> 00:34:42.944
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

433
00:35:03.299 --> 00:35:04.883
Since when do you speak Italian?

434
00:35:05.509 --> 00:35:08.470
Oh.
Self-improvement month.

435
00:35:08.554 --> 00:35:10.680
I guess somebody
gave me a wake up call.

436
00:35:11.515 --> 00:35:12.933
I hope you didn't do it for me.

437
00:35:13.017 --> 00:35:15.143
No, I just wanted
to apologize to you, Lin.

438
00:35:16.395 --> 00:35:19.940
And let you know that apparently
my capacity for self-sabotage

439
00:35:20.024 --> 00:35:22.025
wasn't boundless after all.

440
00:35:23.736 --> 00:35:26.071
The real question is,
why did you ever put up with me?

441
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.157
I was in love with you.

442
00:35:35.915 --> 00:35:37.457
So, when does the book come out?

443
00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:39.417
Next year.
How's your new assistant?

444
00:35:39.502 --> 00:35:41.169
- She's good.
- Good.

445
00:35:41.253 --> 00:35:43.588
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

446
00:35:46.092 --> 00:35:48.093
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...

447
00:35:48.177 --> 00:35:51.304
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.

448
00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:58.436
I'm proud of you. And...

449
00:36:04.443 --> 00:36:06.152
...a little intimidated.

450
00:36:07.655 --> 00:36:09.781
We started up again.

451
00:36:11.951 --> 00:36:13.201
Her place.

452
00:36:17.854 --> 00:36:19.021
My place.

453
00:36:21.608 --> 00:36:23.067
Basically every place.

454
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.948
"In a sizzling
three days of trading,"

455
00:36:29.032 --> 00:36:31.826
the unknown Mr. Morra
trumped the market,

456
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.453
prompting one top
hedge fund manager to comment:

457
00:36:34.538 --> 00:36:37.456
'He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."'

458
00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:38.874
OK, give me that.
Give me that!

459
00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:41.168
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?

460
00:36:41.753 --> 00:36:44.130
I can't. I don't have a key.

461
00:36:44.214 --> 00:36:45.965
Oh, that's right.

462
00:36:46.049 --> 00:36:49.552
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.

463
00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:51.470
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?

464
00:36:51.555 --> 00:36:53.389
Can it be a new key?

465
00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:56.267
To our place?

466
00:36:58.019 --> 00:37:01.939
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.

467
00:37:13.577 --> 00:37:15.244
Can I walk you to work?

468
00:37:32.554 --> 00:37:34.305
Whatcha doing, hon?

469
00:37:35.182 --> 00:37:36.849
Nothing.

470
00:37:37.976 --> 00:37:39.852
You should sleep.

471
00:37:42.689 --> 00:37:44.565
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?

472
00:37:59.498 --> 00:38:02.041
Eddie?

473
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:03.959
Are you OK?

474
00:38:06.213 --> 00:38:08.339
What are you doing out here?

475
00:38:12.552 --> 00:38:14.970
When's the last time you ate something?

476
00:38:22.521 --> 00:38:26.315
There he is.
Nice article in the Post, buddy.

477
00:38:28.318 --> 00:38:30.986
OK, he is on his way.

478
00:38:31.696 --> 00:38:34.365
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.

479
00:38:34.783 --> 00:38:37.785
One minute, your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

480
00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:41.997
And he needs direct answers. Anything
tentative and you've lost him forever.

481
00:38:44.084 --> 00:38:45.751
I think we should rehearse
a few scenarios.

482
00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:47.586
I'm eating, Kevin.

483
00:38:48.129 --> 00:38:49.797
Hey, are you up for this?

484
00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:53.050
You sure? 'Cause I got
a little bit on the line here.

485
00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:55.219
Have a toast point.

486
00:38:57.847 --> 00:38:59.765
- It's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.

487
00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:00.849
He's worth a fortune.

488
00:39:00.934 --> 00:39:04.103
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.

489
00:39:04.187 --> 00:39:05.771
- How are ya?
- Eddie.

490
00:39:12.862 --> 00:39:15.281
So, Eddie Morra.

491
00:39:15.365 --> 00:39:18.409
- What's your secret?
- Medication.

492
00:39:18.493 --> 00:39:20.202
I'm on special medication.

493
00:39:20.745 --> 00:39:22.246
OK.

494
00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:26.792
Well, it's a formula
with a complex method.

495
00:39:26.876 --> 00:39:29.295
But, of course, research was
a component. Massive research.

496
00:39:29.379 --> 00:39:32.423
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA
in every company I bought.

497
00:39:32.507 --> 00:39:35.134
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office, and you know what?

498
00:39:35.218 --> 00:39:37.344
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.

499
00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:40.598
Sure, the stocks rose,
but who wants to do all that work

500
00:39:40.682 --> 00:39:42.224
for a shitty little uptake?

501
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:45.477
It's not the visceral kind of spike
you want in short term holdings so...

502
00:39:45.562 --> 00:39:47.229
...I dispensed
with all the hard statistics

503
00:39:47.314 --> 00:39:48.606
and I went right to the rumor mill.

504
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.817
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

505
00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:55.404
Sure. Share prices aren't really
based on how a company works.

506
00:39:55.488 --> 00:39:56.989
It's about how mass psychology works.

507
00:39:57.073 --> 00:39:59.283
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

508
00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:01.660
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.

509
00:40:01.745 --> 00:40:04.038
Well, not everybody
understands the patterns.

510
00:40:04.122 --> 00:40:06.832
And that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

511
00:40:06.916 --> 00:40:08.500
So then, I went on
to door number three.

512
00:40:08.585 --> 00:40:11.920
Are you really implying that you have
some sort of ultimate formula?

513
00:40:12.005 --> 00:40:15.257
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.

514
00:40:15.342 --> 00:40:18.802
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.

515
00:40:18.887 --> 00:40:23.098
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

516
00:40:26.061 --> 00:40:29.188
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what
you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.

517
00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:30.648
You don't work in my world.

518
00:40:30.732 --> 00:40:34.151
I'm up to my ass with investment guys
and you don't have their half-terrified,

519
00:40:34.235 --> 00:40:36.278
half-cocky line of crap which is...

520
00:40:36.363 --> 00:40:39.073
...not to say that
I like yours any better.

521
00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:42.117
But you obviously pick your stocks
in a way which I haven't seen before.

522
00:40:42.202 --> 00:40:46.121
Take a look at these companies
and tell me what you think.

523
00:40:46.206 --> 00:40:48.582
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.

524
00:40:51.044 --> 00:40:52.461
Sure.

525
00:41:05.308 --> 00:41:07.976
These companies aren't the question,
are they?

526
00:41:09.437 --> 00:41:10.688
Explain.

527
00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:14.316
Unless you're playing
both sides of the fence.

528
00:41:14.401 --> 00:41:16.235
Control the whole power enchilada,
but, no,

529
00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:18.779
these companies wouldn't get you there
in emerging markets.

530
00:41:18.863 --> 00:41:20.906
You would have to... Oh. Whoa.

531
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:24.660
This must be some big-ass merger
you're contemplating.

532
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.622
And there's really only one company
with enough bling

533
00:41:28.707 --> 00:41:30.708
to justify a merger
with Van Loon and Associates.

534
00:41:32.001 --> 00:41:33.711
Who have you been talking to?

535
00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:37.423
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

536
00:41:37.507 --> 00:41:41.051
Well, you're an amazing con artist,
or you're a very smart young man.

537
00:41:41.136 --> 00:41:43.846
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?

538
00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.472
The whole world would have
to come begging for energy

539
00:41:45.557 --> 00:41:47.599
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel.

540
00:41:47.684 --> 00:41:50.185
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?

541
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.523
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?

542
00:41:54.607 --> 00:41:57.985
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?

543
00:41:59.195 --> 00:42:02.531
Well, you don't want to hear this from
some schmuck who needs a ride home.

544
00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:06.285
All right, you get your shot. Meet me
tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

545
00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:08.620
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck
who needs a ride home

546
00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:11.957
would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.

547
00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:13.542
I'm at your disposal.

548
00:42:13.626 --> 00:42:15.627
You don't really live here,
do you?

549
00:42:15.712 --> 00:42:17.921
Well... Spartans weren't
big on amenities.

550
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.216
Yeah, and they eventually
got their asses kicked.

551
00:42:28.475 --> 00:42:33.812
I didn't go in. I wanted
to walk, move, digest, ingest.

552
00:42:33.897 --> 00:42:37.191
There are moments in life... moments
when you know you've crossed a bridge.

553
00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:38.609
Your old life is over.

554
00:42:38.693 --> 00:42:41.570
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.

555
00:42:41.654 --> 00:42:45.157
Wall Street would provide my nest egg,
but then how far could I go?

556
00:42:45.241 --> 00:42:48.952
CEO? A global force?
Maybe President.

557
00:42:49.037 --> 00:42:51.789
Time somebody shook up the free world
and got things done.

558
00:43:03.843 --> 00:43:05.594
Suddenly...

559
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:12.267
- It was another skip.
- How had I gone the last 20 blocks?

560
00:43:14.437 --> 00:43:18.732
I got another ten blocks.
And then...

561
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.195
...I was way uptown.

562
00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:09.015
What bar was this?

563
00:44:21.654 --> 00:44:25.156
...black canvas and then they would
just drop all the paint...

564
00:44:27.284 --> 00:44:29.703
Yeah. Did you ever meet...

565
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.415
...and then I actually went there
and had lunch, I went back.

566
00:44:33.499 --> 00:44:34.541
My friends are rolling...

567
00:44:36.794 --> 00:44:38.712
I heard you like to party.

568
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.071
- Hey, watch it.
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

569
00:45:05.156 --> 00:45:08.199
A fight? Don't know how to fight.

570
00:45:08.284 --> 00:45:09.743
Or do I?

571
00:45:18.335 --> 00:45:19.335
Ah!

572
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.255
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.

573
00:45:23.132 --> 00:45:25.550
Like this.

574
00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:38.188
Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.

575
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.904
If you are hit, do not stop.

576
00:45:45.988 --> 00:45:48.573
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.

577
00:45:50.284 --> 00:45:51.409
Off-balancing your opponent

578
00:45:51.494 --> 00:45:54.370
and then using his momentum, take him down.

579
00:46:25.402 --> 00:46:27.737
When it finally stopped,

580
00:46:27.822 --> 00:46:31.366
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.

581
00:46:53.472 --> 00:46:56.141
Hey, it's me. I thought you were coming over.

582
00:46:56.225 --> 00:46:58.977
Is everything OK? Call me when you get this.

583
00:47:38.601 --> 00:47:43.396
Even off NZT, I decided
to give Van Loon's files a shot.

584
00:47:50.529 --> 00:47:52.822
They were hieroglyphs.

585
00:47:56.202 --> 00:47:58.786
- Hello?
- Kevin, this is Eddie.

586
00:47:58.871 --> 00:47:59.871
- Eddie?
- Listen,

587
00:47:59.955 --> 00:48:02.916
- I can't make the meeting today.
- What are you talking about?

588
00:48:04.251 --> 00:48:05.627
I can't come in today, I'm sick.

589
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:07.921
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now.

590
00:48:08.005 --> 00:48:09.297
He'll never give you this chance again.

591
00:48:09.381 --> 00:48:14.969
I know, listen, I just... I have all this data to analyze...

592
00:48:15.054 --> 00:48:17.805
What have you been doing for the last day?

593
00:48:19.266 --> 00:48:22.143
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.

594
00:48:22.853 --> 00:48:25.813
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now.

595
00:48:25.898 --> 00:48:28.024
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

596
00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:30.818
- I know, listen, I just...
- Sh. Listen to me.

597
00:48:30.903 --> 00:48:33.655
Pull yourself together. Get down to the meeting.

598
00:48:40.162 --> 00:48:43.706
OK, OK. I'll be there. I'll be there.

599
00:49:05.187 --> 00:49:07.480
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.

600
00:49:07.564 --> 00:49:09.232
Good to see you again.

601
00:49:10.484 --> 00:49:11.818
Sit down.

602
00:49:15.698 --> 00:49:17.282
What do you know about Hank Atwood?

603
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.200
Atwood, um...

604
00:49:20.577 --> 00:49:23.162
He's an iconoclast, um...

605
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.167
Owns about half of Colorado.

606
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.254
So this is prepared, Eddie?

607
00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:33.339
Uh...

608
00:49:33.424 --> 00:49:36.592
Is this Atwood 101? Doesn't everybody
know about Atwood?

609
00:49:36.677 --> 00:49:38.344
Where was he two years ago?

610
00:49:40.806 --> 00:49:43.683
- Hm?
- Nowhere.

611
00:49:45.436 --> 00:49:48.438
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar.

612
00:49:49.815 --> 00:49:52.317
That was a great leap forward, right?

613
00:49:53.193 --> 00:49:56.946
I'm baffled by this guy. He comes
out of nowhere so strong.

614
00:49:57.031 --> 00:49:59.949
Has me on the run before I can even
get to anybody in his camp.

615
00:50:00.034 --> 00:50:01.701
Beats me out of two properties,

616
00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:04.370
investing in countries with no
oil. Places I'd never go near...

617
00:50:11.754 --> 00:50:14.088
We're here in front
of the hotel where a woman,

618
00:50:14.173 --> 00:50:17.925
identified as Maria Winberg, was found
dead in her room last night,

619
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:22.722
a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg was
a well-known socialite and model...

620
00:50:24.183 --> 00:50:28.436
...but was also known for her dedicated
charity work around the city.

621
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.689
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons

622
00:50:31.774 --> 00:50:34.984
and an eyewitness reported seeing
a man leaving the scene...

623
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:38.780
...help me convince him that I
can raise his game. Got any ideas?

624
00:50:38.864 --> 00:50:40.615
What do you think?

625
00:50:41.992 --> 00:50:43.826
- Hm?
- Um...

626
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.371
...hotel has adequate security cameras...

627
00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:53.503
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?

628
00:50:53.587 --> 00:50:55.671
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?

629
00:50:57.925 --> 00:51:00.635
These are tectonic plates that
are shifting right under us.

630
00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:02.345
Pardon me, one second.

631
00:51:24.493 --> 00:51:28.079
Was it possible? Could I have killed someone?

632
00:51:30.124 --> 00:51:32.250
Was it even me?

633
00:51:36.922 --> 00:51:39.549
Eddie? This is Melissa.

634
00:51:39.633 --> 00:51:41.801
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving
you anything, has he?

635
00:51:41.885 --> 00:51:43.511
Because that stuff is dangerous.

636
00:51:43.595 --> 00:51:45.054
Melissa?

637
00:51:45.139 --> 00:51:47.473
Melissa, hey, do you think that
we can meet somewhere?

638
00:51:47.558 --> 00:51:50.226
- I really need to talk to you.
- We're talking now.

639
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:53.646
No, no, let's meet at, uh... Billy's on Grant at noon?

640
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.065
- You can't see me, Eddie.
- No, no...

641
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:59.235
- Eddie, please.
- Please, please come, please come, I...

642
00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:02.405
It's important, I really need to know
what you're talking about.

643
00:52:04.992 --> 00:52:08.244
I realized that there were other
people who might know about NZT.

644
00:52:08.328 --> 00:52:10.705
Vernon's other clients.

645
00:52:50.496 --> 00:52:51.454
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi,

646
00:52:51.538 --> 00:52:52.997
may I please speak with Jerry Brady?

647
00:52:53.081 --> 00:52:55.458
- Jerry's in the hospital.
- He's what?

648
00:52:55.542 --> 00:52:57.418
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.

649
00:52:57.503 --> 00:53:02.340
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
- Uh, no. No, he's not.

650
00:53:02.424 --> 00:53:05.718
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.

651
00:53:06.845 --> 00:53:08.596
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

652
00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.265
Yeah, he started getting headaches,
then he collapsed at work.

653
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:12.767
Now he's in the ICU.

654
00:53:12.851 --> 00:53:15.061
OK, please give him my best. Thank you.

655
00:53:15.145 --> 00:53:20.525
Of all the people I called... three
were dead and the rest were sick.

656
00:53:43.465 --> 00:53:48.094
Hello? Hello?

657
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280
Watch it, man!

658
00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:25.673
Did you see that?

659
00:54:27.217 --> 00:54:28.217
Hey!

660
00:54:34.057 --> 00:54:37.476
Go! Go!

661
00:55:04.338 --> 00:55:05.630
Eddie.

662
00:55:07.674 --> 00:55:09.508
Melissa.

663
00:55:16.767 --> 00:55:18.059
Hey.

664
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.274
Don't tell me I look good, 'cause I know.

665
00:55:27.235 --> 00:55:29.236
I didn't want you to see me this way.

666
00:55:29.863 --> 00:55:31.697
You look good.

667
00:55:31.782 --> 00:55:34.492
Oh, I, uh...

668
00:55:34.576 --> 00:55:36.619
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.

669
00:55:36.703 --> 00:55:39.163
NZT will do that to you.

670
00:55:39.247 --> 00:55:42.166
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.

671
00:55:43.126 --> 00:55:45.878
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?

672
00:55:45.962 --> 00:55:47.046
No.

673
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.839
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,

674
00:55:48.924 --> 00:55:52.885
I was like, down the hatch. And it was. It was amazing.

675
00:55:52.969 --> 00:55:56.639
I read Brian Greene's The Elegant
Universe in 45 minutes

676
00:55:56.723 --> 00:55:58.557
and I understood it.

677
00:55:58.642 --> 00:56:00.935
My work rate increased just insanely overnight

678
00:56:01.019 --> 00:56:02.728
and my boss started to hate me.

679
00:56:04.523 --> 00:56:09.402
They offered me his job and then...
and then I got scared.

680
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.571
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.

681
00:56:12.656 --> 00:56:15.908
Nobody can operate at that level
of mental activity and not crash.

682
00:56:18.745 --> 00:56:20.621
I stopped taking it.

683
00:56:20.706 --> 00:56:25.042
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.

684
00:56:25.127 --> 00:56:30.464
Throwing up. So I went back to Vernon.

685
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:33.050
He told me about all the people that were dying.

686
00:56:34.344 --> 00:56:36.303
How much have you been taking, Eddie?

687
00:56:36.388 --> 00:56:38.055
I've been taking a lot.

688
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:44.061
Well, maybe... maybe they've
worked out the bugs. Maybe...

689
00:56:44.938 --> 00:56:46.522
Maybe this is a different batch.

690
00:56:47.941 --> 00:56:50.776
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?

691
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:53.362
- Just finish your story.
- Well...

692
00:56:53.447 --> 00:56:56.282
...I didn't take any more and I didn't die.

693
00:56:57.617 --> 00:57:00.703
But after a while, I realized I couldn't
concentrate on anything

694
00:57:00.787 --> 00:57:01.996
for longer than ten minutes.

695
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:07.168
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow.

696
00:57:07.878 --> 00:57:10.337
That was two years ago.

697
00:57:12.299 --> 00:57:14.341
And I haven't been the same since.

698
00:57:19.055 --> 00:57:22.933
Do you have some left? Good.

699
00:57:23.018 --> 00:57:26.395
You go home and you take it. You take
the dose down, but you don'tjust stop.

700
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.230
You'll die if you just stop.

701
00:57:28.857 --> 00:57:33.652
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches
are just the beginning.

702
00:57:35.822 --> 00:57:37.198
I have to go.

703
00:57:39.117 --> 00:57:41.660
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.

704
00:57:43.246 --> 00:57:44.705
I have to go.

705
00:58:15.403 --> 00:58:20.199
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.

706
00:58:20.283 --> 00:58:21.992
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no.

707
00:58:22.077 --> 00:58:24.036
12:00 and you're not here.

708
00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.289
- I'm here now. Oh!
- Good.

709
00:58:27.374 --> 00:58:30.417
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.

710
00:58:30.502 --> 00:58:35.464
Check. Check. Are you out of your mind?

711
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:37.800
What do you think I am? Some financial institution?

712
00:58:37.884 --> 00:58:39.969
All right. You're right. Look, we
just need to go to a bank...

713
00:58:44.558 --> 00:58:46.934
What do you got there?

714
00:58:51.231 --> 00:58:53.649
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.

715
00:58:53.733 --> 00:58:59.238
Don't look like no aspirin I ever
see. It's something good, huh?

716
00:59:18.008 --> 00:59:22.136
I feel good, man. What's in this stuff?

717
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.014
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin.

718
00:59:25.098 --> 00:59:28.809
You full of shit, Eddie baby.

719
00:59:54.294 --> 00:59:57.254
Lindy. I wouldn't have let him in, but...

720
00:59:57.339 --> 01:00:00.090
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.

721
01:00:01.301 --> 01:00:02.968
I'm sick.

722
01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:08.349
I shouldn't... I'm sorry. I couldn't make it home.

723
01:00:08.433 --> 01:00:11.518
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...

724
01:00:11.603 --> 01:00:12.645
I need you to get...

725
01:00:12.729 --> 01:00:16.732
It's really simple, babe. I need my pills.

726
01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:19.401
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.

727
01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:22.237
What are you taking? Are you on drugs?

728
01:00:22.322 --> 01:00:25.240
They're... it's...

729
01:00:25.325 --> 01:00:28.661
I had no choice. I told Lindy everything.

730
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:34.750
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...

731
01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:36.126
...has been a drug.

732
01:00:36.211 --> 01:00:38.587
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

733
01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:42.257
I have a... a supply stashed.

734
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.761
You want me to go get it.

735
01:00:45.845 --> 01:00:49.306
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.

736
01:00:49.391 --> 01:00:51.058
I'll go to your apartment.

737
01:00:51.142 --> 01:00:55.020
It's not... in my apartment. I moved it.

738
01:00:55.105 --> 01:00:58.899
OK, so where did you move it?

739
01:01:05.699 --> 01:01:07.574
In my house.

740
01:01:08.411 --> 01:01:09.869
Unbelievable.

741
01:01:22.133 --> 01:01:24.884
Hey, have you got it?

742
01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:26.553
Yeah.

743
01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.140
There's someone following me.

744
01:01:31.726 --> 01:01:32.934
Are you sure?

745
01:01:33.019 --> 01:01:35.478
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me

746
01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:37.564
and he's making every turn I'm making.

747
01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:41.484
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?

748
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:42.819
Babe, what's happening?

749
01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:44.696
We're stopped dead.

750
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:48.366
He's getting out.

751
01:01:48.451 --> 01:01:50.994
Eddie, he's walking over here.

752
01:01:51.078 --> 01:01:52.078
Lindy?

753
01:01:52.997 --> 01:01:54.080
Oh, God!

754
01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:57.083
Ow!

755
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.182
Help! Help!

756
01:02:13.768 --> 01:02:16.352
This man's... This man's chasing me!

757
01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:19.981
He followed me from
my building. I don't know him.

758
01:02:20.066 --> 01:02:23.443
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

759
01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:28.114
Are you deaf? I said leave her alone.

760
01:02:30.201 --> 01:02:32.327
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?

761
01:02:34.121 --> 01:02:36.372
What are you doing, man?

762
01:03:07.905 --> 01:03:10.824
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?

763
01:03:10.908 --> 01:03:14.077
I'm stuck. He'll find me.

764
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:16.162
OK, stop talking. Don't move.

765
01:03:16.247 --> 01:03:18.915
- He killed two guys.
- What?

766
01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:22.168
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...

767
01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:23.419
Can he see you?

768
01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:28.633
No.

769
01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:31.219
Not yet.

770
01:03:32.596 --> 01:03:35.139
I don't know what to do.

771
01:03:35.224 --> 01:03:38.935
OK, I need you to go into the
bag and take one of the pills.

772
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.020
Why?

773
01:03:41.105 --> 01:03:43.523
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.

774
01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:47.527
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't
think my way out of a knife.

775
01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:50.822
Just listen to me. It'll come on in 30 seconds.

776
01:03:50.906 --> 01:03:52.782
And you'll think your way out. That's what it does.

777
01:04:16.307 --> 01:04:19.893
He's getting closer.

778
01:04:22.521 --> 01:04:24.022
Lindy, I love you.

779
01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:57.639
Hey!

780
01:05:35.344 --> 01:05:36.928
Now turn to me...

781
01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:40.473
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

782
01:05:42.267 --> 01:05:44.852
- Ah!
- Daddy!

783
01:05:44.937 --> 01:05:46.479
Ah!

784
01:05:55.197 --> 01:05:56.781
Eddie. Here.

785
01:05:57.908 --> 01:05:59.993
It's gonna be OK.

786
01:06:02.287 --> 01:06:05.790
We've got to get out of here. Eddie?

787
01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:41.284
You OK?

788
01:06:42.745 --> 01:06:44.537
Yeah.

789
01:06:46.415 --> 01:06:49.751
I'm so sorry about what happened.

790
01:06:49.835 --> 01:06:52.920
I want you to know that you never,
ever have to go through that again,

791
01:06:53.005 --> 01:06:55.757
'cause I can take care of us now.

792
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:57.884
I'm sure you can.

793
01:06:57.968 --> 01:07:00.428
I can make us safe. I'm back, OK?

794
01:07:04.767 --> 01:07:07.060
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.

795
01:07:07.144 --> 01:07:09.562
No. It's not you.

796
01:07:09.646 --> 01:07:13.232
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.

797
01:07:13.317 --> 01:07:14.942
I wasn't, when I was on it.

798
01:07:16.153 --> 01:07:18.279
I did things I would never do.

799
01:07:18.363 --> 01:07:20.948
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.

800
01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:22.575
Yes, they were. No, the way it works...

801
01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:25.119
I know how it works. I get it.

802
01:07:25.204 --> 01:07:27.997
I totally get it. You feel invincible.

803
01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:31.918
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine.

804
01:07:32.002 --> 01:07:36.422
The things we'll be able to do. Where
we'll be a year from now.

805
01:07:36.507 --> 01:07:40.176
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live.

806
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.471
Well, you might have to live it without me.

807
01:07:47.518 --> 01:07:50.144
Look, I am gonna stop taking it. There's
just some things I have to do

808
01:07:50.229 --> 01:07:53.773
to keep us safe and that... To set us
up and then I'm gonna get off it.

809
01:07:53.857 --> 01:07:55.441
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...

810
01:07:55.526 --> 01:07:57.819
Look, I have a plan. I swear.

811
01:07:57.903 --> 01:07:59.695
I'm gonna get off it.

812
01:08:01.156 --> 01:08:02.490
OK.

813
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:06.035
I hope you do.

814
01:08:38.235 --> 01:08:40.111
Looking for me?

815
01:08:42.489 --> 01:08:46.159
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?

816
01:08:46.243 --> 01:08:47.994
I was under the impression our business was settled.

817
01:08:48.078 --> 01:08:49.871
I want some more of that stuff.

818
01:08:49.955 --> 01:08:52.915
Or I shoot you right here. Take your pick.

819
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.792
This guy was not going away.

820
01:08:54.877 --> 01:08:56.627
A few pills would buy me some time.

821
01:08:56.712 --> 01:09:00.089
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.

822
01:09:00.174 --> 01:09:02.717
Until I found a more... permanent solution.

823
01:09:03.552 --> 01:09:07.305
Unless you see a real threat, I never want
it known that I have any security.

824
01:09:07.389 --> 01:09:09.599
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me.

825
01:09:09.683 --> 01:09:13.144
Never more than 15 steps behind. And
never stand too close together.

826
01:09:13.228 --> 01:09:15.938
I want to able to look behind me
if the opportunity presents itself.

827
01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:19.609
And don't wear the same color
suit. This isn't The Matrix.

828
01:09:25.365 --> 01:09:27.533
You have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off.

829
01:09:27.618 --> 01:09:29.243
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.

830
01:09:29.328 --> 01:09:32.038
You're playing at this level, you get
hit by a car, you don't even die.

831
01:09:32.122 --> 01:09:34.790
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

832
01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:36.751
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to.

833
01:09:36.835 --> 01:09:40.046
A hundred and five. That's who you
were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

834
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.673
Mm-hm.

835
01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:44.467
I sent over my revised projections.

836
01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:45.468
I didn't ask for your projections.

837
01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:48.704
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...

838
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:50.790
I already have. As a matter of fact...

839
01:09:52.334 --> 01:09:55.545
...I fired a few people over your projections.

840
01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:57.255
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

841
01:09:57.339 --> 01:10:00.133
You're relieved that you know things my team missed.

842
01:10:00.217 --> 01:10:04.762
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...

843
01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:09.267
Two months after I'd started NZT,

844
01:10:09.351 --> 01:10:12.436
I was brokering the biggest merger
in corporate history.

845
01:10:12.521 --> 01:10:16.941
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude is
gonna be where we're gonna hit them.

846
01:10:17.025 --> 01:10:19.652
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent.

847
01:10:19.736 --> 01:10:21.612
That makes both of us very happy campers.

848
01:10:21.697 --> 01:10:24.073
I found that if I maintained an even dose,

849
01:10:24.158 --> 01:10:26.492
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,

850
01:10:26.577 --> 01:10:28.995
- the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?

851
01:10:29.955 --> 01:10:32.915
Tom, is it possible to construct an
imperceptible compartment?

852
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.458
In this jacket?

853
01:10:34.543 --> 01:10:37.962
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.

854
01:10:38.046 --> 01:10:42.133
Safer though my stash now was,
I was not sitting around until it ran out.

855
01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:45.553
Can I combine these ingredients in
the same exact quantity, yes, but,

856
01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:50.433
the exact method of delivery to the
brain... Darts at a dartboard.

857
01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:53.144
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.

858
01:10:53.228 --> 01:10:55.730
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.

859
01:10:55.814 --> 01:10:59.317
Or you'll kill people. You need 12, to 18 months...

860
01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:01.527
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six.

861
01:11:10.078 --> 01:11:13.998
I found that we can cut costs 30 percent and, um...

862
01:11:17.419 --> 01:11:18.753
Excuse me one second.

863
01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:24.467
I thought we straightened this out, Detective.

864
01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:28.471
This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra.

865
01:11:28.555 --> 01:11:30.932
What is this about?

866
01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:36.354
The witness identified the Maria
Winberg suspect as this person.

867
01:11:41.026 --> 01:11:43.945
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night ofApril 2nd?

868
01:11:45.906 --> 01:11:48.115
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.

869
01:11:49.284 --> 01:11:53.788
Enter Morris Brandt... the most
lethal lawyer in New York.

870
01:11:56.792 --> 01:12:01.462
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.

871
01:12:01.546 --> 01:12:04.548
Just between us, were you there?

872
01:12:04.633 --> 01:12:05.883
I don't remember.

873
01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:09.011
I don't want to make concessions to you...

874
01:12:09.096 --> 01:12:11.138
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

875
01:12:11.223 --> 01:12:15.226
had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.

876
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.979
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying

877
01:12:18.063 --> 01:12:20.064
for the same industrial concessions in Libya

878
01:12:20.148 --> 01:12:22.400
that both our companies are pretending
we're not sniffing out.

879
01:12:22.484 --> 01:12:23.859
How do you know this?

880
01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:27.530
The governmental bribe system
is itself corrupt, so, of course,

881
01:12:27.614 --> 01:12:30.741
information about its inner workings,
like anything, can be bought.

882
01:12:33.328 --> 01:12:34.704
Go on.

883
01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:38.165
If you take a look at the lower
left-hand column, in 2008,

884
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.669
five companies were jockeying for a
position before we even took notice.

885
01:12:45.048 --> 01:12:46.757
Jesus, he looks frail.

886
01:12:47.801 --> 01:12:50.177
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

887
01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:55.558
So, have you decided, Eddie? What are you gonna do?

888
01:12:55.642 --> 01:12:58.728
When this is over? I don't know.

889
01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:00.187
You haven't given me the answer.

890
01:13:00.272 --> 01:13:02.106
You haven't asked the question.

891
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.941
Well, given the scale of my contribution,

892
01:13:04.026 --> 01:13:06.360
let's say 45.

893
01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:09.447
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.

894
01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:12.950
Forty million is plenty, Eddie. There's
a lot more where that came from.

895
01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:15.328
You know, Eddie...

896
01:13:15.412 --> 01:13:16.454
...it may be on your mind

897
01:13:16.538 --> 01:13:18.956
that you're not gonna continue
to work for me anymore.

898
01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:20.750
This has been the learning experience of my life.

899
01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:23.294
I hope it has. I hope you don't think
you've gotten enough from me.

900
01:13:23.378 --> 01:13:24.920
On to the next.

901
01:13:25.005 --> 01:13:27.757
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

902
01:13:27.841 --> 01:13:30.301
That you would even think that would only show me

903
01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:32.803
how unprepared you are to be on your own.

904
01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:35.264
I mean, you do know you're a freak.

905
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:37.850
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance,

906
01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:40.269
or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever,
or whoever the hell wrote

907
01:13:40.354 --> 01:13:42.646
your life script, a gift not earned.

908
01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:46.609
You do not know what I know because
you have not earned those powers.

909
01:13:46.693 --> 01:13:48.402
You're careless with those powers.

910
01:13:48.487 --> 01:13:51.781
You flaunt them and you throw them around
like a brat with his trust fund.

911
01:13:51.865 --> 01:13:54.825
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs.

912
01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:57.870
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers.
You haven't done the time

913
01:13:57.954 --> 01:13:59.789
in that first marriage to the girl with the right father.

914
01:13:59.873 --> 01:14:02.583
You think you can leap over all in a single bound.

915
01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:05.169
You haven't had to bribe or charm
or threaten your way

916
01:14:05.253 --> 01:14:08.464
to a seat at that table. You don't know
how to assess your competition

917
01:14:08.548 --> 01:14:11.759
because you haven't competed. Don't
make me your competition.

918
01:14:14.596 --> 01:14:16.639
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you.

919
01:14:16.723 --> 01:14:18.766
You'll be wanting a few toys.

920
01:14:35.451 --> 01:14:38.120
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.

921
01:14:38.204 --> 01:14:40.205
What I needed was a bunker.

922
01:14:40.289 --> 01:14:42.707
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance,

923
01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:45.377
vault grade pneumatic doors.

924
01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:48.755
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system.

925
01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.217
A fortress with a hell of a view.

926
01:14:56.472 --> 01:14:59.224
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.

927
01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:05.605
I'll take it.

928
01:15:11.237 --> 01:15:14.072
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.

929
01:15:14.157 --> 01:15:16.825
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.

930
01:15:16.909 --> 01:15:18.869
Next week, you can go fuck yourself!

931
01:15:18.953 --> 01:15:20.537
Not that you'd feel anything.

932
01:15:21.497 --> 01:15:25.167
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial
friends would appreciate

933
01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:28.378
the details of your little dilemma with the police.

934
01:15:29.338 --> 01:15:32.090
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.

935
01:15:35.136 --> 01:15:36.553
Getting smarter!

936
01:15:38.431 --> 01:15:40.432
Obviously, this could not go on,

937
01:15:40.516 --> 01:15:43.685
but there is very little on this earth
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

938
01:15:43.769 --> 01:15:47.397
And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.

939
01:15:54.672 --> 01:15:57.674
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?

940
01:15:57.758 --> 01:16:00.343
There was all last night to tell us that.

941
01:16:01.887 --> 01:16:05.140
- Anything?
- I'll call him again, sir.

942
01:16:05.224 --> 01:16:07.434
OK, the decision could have
changed. That makes sense.

943
01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:10.895
The discourtesy doesn't. It's still on.

944
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:13.898
Oh, based on your charts and projections.

945
01:16:14.859 --> 01:16:17.068
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?

946
01:16:17.153 --> 01:16:19.863
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this
unqualified, posturing little prick.

947
01:16:19.947 --> 01:16:22.073
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

948
01:16:22.158 --> 01:16:25.994
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

949
01:16:26.078 --> 01:16:27.537
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.

950
01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.876
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.

951
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.378
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.

952
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.425
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible.

953
01:16:40.509 --> 01:16:42.093
Of course.

954
01:16:42.178 --> 01:16:46.097
My husband experienced some pain
and dizziness this morning.

955
01:16:46.182 --> 01:16:48.725
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests.

956
01:16:49.935 --> 01:16:51.895
I just want you to know we have every intention

957
01:16:51.979 --> 01:16:53.688
of signing the contract.

958
01:16:54.523 --> 01:16:57.734
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.

959
01:16:58.903 --> 01:17:01.821
I realize this is a useless platitude, but
if there's anything that we can do,

960
01:17:01.906 --> 01:17:03.239
please don't hesitate to tell us.

961
01:17:03.324 --> 01:17:05.158
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful

962
01:17:05.242 --> 01:17:06.785
as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

963
01:17:06.869 --> 01:17:09.662
Thank you, gentlemen. I rely on your discretion.

964
01:17:11.707 --> 01:17:12.749
There won't be a proxy.

965
01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:15.877
No, a cagey prick like him giving
away power of attorney?

966
01:17:20.341 --> 01:17:22.342
Well, he'd better get better.

967
01:17:25.471 --> 01:17:29.891
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.

968
01:17:33.396 --> 01:17:36.940
Well, why be surprised?

969
01:17:37.024 --> 01:17:40.443
How many other meteoric
rises might be explained by NZT?

970
01:17:40.528 --> 01:17:41.945
At least I had some.

971
01:17:42.029 --> 01:17:44.155
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.

972
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.242
Only my money. And my liberty.

973
01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:50.036
I've been all over with them.

974
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:52.497
We can't allow any disparity in race

975
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:55.333
or physical type between you
and the rest of the line up.

976
01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:56.376
OK.

977
01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.837
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get.

978
01:17:58.921 --> 01:18:02.674
It's gotta be just one
big handsome blur to this guy.

979
01:18:16.439 --> 01:18:18.356
Who was out there?

980
01:18:20.109 --> 01:18:21.985
The woman's husband?

981
01:18:22.778 --> 01:18:24.696
A hotel maid?

982
01:18:26.657 --> 01:18:29.159
Was this how it was all going to end?

983
01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:36.040
Not the dimmest clue. He was dithering.

984
01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:39.043
"He was the third one from the right. No. Not him."

985
01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:44.549
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?

986
01:18:44.633 --> 01:18:46.217
I did.

987
01:19:03.068 --> 01:19:04.903
...market's been mixed today.

988
01:19:04.987 --> 01:19:07.697
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that

989
01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:12.494
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood
have negotiated a merger...

990
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:15.371
Have you been talking to anyone?

991
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:19.584
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.

992
01:19:19.668 --> 01:19:20.919
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

993
01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:22.921
but don't make the classic smart person's mistake.

994
01:19:23.005 --> 01:19:24.881
Thinking no one's smarter than you.

995
01:19:24.965 --> 01:19:28.092
Where the hell have you been? This is the
second time you've turned to vapor.

996
01:19:28.177 --> 01:19:31.054
I was in the building, I was getting coffee.
Why, has there been movement?

997
01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:33.431
Yeah, there's been movement
alright. Atwood's in a coma.

998
01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:36.059
He wasn't playing us. He's dying.

999
01:19:36.143 --> 01:19:37.727
What do you know about this?

1000
01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:41.397
I was less than usually equipped to answer.

1001
01:19:41.482 --> 01:19:45.818
The dullness was coming on. I
was overdue to take my NZT.

1002
01:19:45.903 --> 01:19:49.113
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.

1003
01:19:49.198 --> 01:19:50.448
Excuse me.

1004
01:19:50.533 --> 01:19:52.033
You're not excused.

1005
01:19:52.117 --> 01:19:54.661
What? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?

1006
01:20:17.351 --> 01:20:19.227
Was it Brandt or someone else?

1007
01:20:19.311 --> 01:20:21.896
The police station? A coatroom?

1008
01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:37.161
Mr. Morra.

1009
01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:39.747
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!

1010
01:20:39.832 --> 01:20:41.583
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?

1011
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:50.091
Hope not, so let me know when you know.

1012
01:20:50.801 --> 01:20:52.760
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie.
What do you know about this?

1013
01:20:52.845 --> 01:20:55.805
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.

1014
01:20:55.889 --> 01:20:57.724
What? What about Atwood?

1015
01:20:57.808 --> 01:21:00.059
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo.

1016
01:21:00.144 --> 01:21:01.352
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!

1017
01:21:01.437 --> 01:21:02.812
What you're about to say is bullshit.

1018
01:21:02.896 --> 01:21:04.397
I know there's something you're hiding from me.

1019
01:21:04.481 --> 01:21:06.357
I smell it on you. Right now,

1020
01:21:06.442 --> 01:21:09.819
I wanna know why this clusterfuck
of a deal is dead in the water!

1021
01:21:11.488 --> 01:21:13.531
Carl.

1022
01:21:13.615 --> 01:21:15.616
Eddie! Eddie!

1023
01:21:32.217 --> 01:21:34.161
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,

1024
01:21:34.245 --> 01:21:36.997
more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.

1025
01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:40.876
There is absolutely no truth
to the rumor of this merger.

1026
01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.671
None whatsoever. My husband is having tests.

1027
01:21:44.756 --> 01:21:46.840
This is a difficult time.

1028
01:21:46.925 --> 01:21:50.844
We would appreciate your directing
further questions to our attorney.

1029
01:21:50.929 --> 01:21:53.347
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.

1030
01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:55.849
We're just awaiting the results
of the latest round of tests

1031
01:21:55.934 --> 01:21:56.892
and hoping for the best.

1032
01:21:56.976 --> 01:21:58.393
Thank you.

1033
01:22:37.308 --> 01:22:41.812
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.

1034
01:22:43.106 --> 01:22:45.983
Open up.

1035
01:22:48.236 --> 01:22:50.320
Come on.

1036
01:22:52.573 --> 01:22:54.449
Open the door.

1037
01:23:11.175 --> 01:23:13.885
And so, here I am.

1038
01:23:16.681 --> 01:23:19.349
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.

1039
01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:22.561
But this choice would at least be mine.

1040
01:23:31.988 --> 01:23:36.325
But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live.

1041
01:23:36.409 --> 01:23:40.912
So my foggy brain tried to remember
where one tablet of NZT might be.

1042
01:23:48.212 --> 01:23:52.966
It was possible. And possible was enough.

1043
01:24:16.324 --> 01:24:17.908
Hey, Eddie.

1044
01:24:40.723 --> 01:24:43.683
Now you know I want more,
so why would you upset me?

1045
01:24:45.019 --> 01:24:47.604
I don't like being down to this last one.

1046
01:24:47.688 --> 01:24:49.606
You don't even know how to use it.

1047
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:52.025
You don't appreciate it.

1048
01:24:52.110 --> 01:24:55.195
You see, I dissolve in a solution.

1049
01:24:55.279 --> 01:24:59.950
You shoot it. It goes straight into the blood and brain.

1050
01:25:01.577 --> 01:25:03.745
Lasts much longer.

1051
01:25:18.594 --> 01:25:20.178
So...

1052
01:25:20.263 --> 01:25:22.889
You gonna tell me where the rest is?

1053
01:25:22.974 --> 01:25:24.641
I'm plumb out.

1054
01:25:29.272 --> 01:25:31.982
You know, these guys are gonna find it.

1055
01:25:33.151 --> 01:25:35.694
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.

1056
01:25:35.778 --> 01:25:38.738
Question is, which is gonna come first?

1057
01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:41.825
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?

1058
01:25:45.496 --> 01:25:48.790
This is a waste of my time, you know?

1059
01:25:48.875 --> 01:25:51.793
I'm getting out of this side of the business.

1060
01:25:51.878 --> 01:25:56.590
I'm branching out. I'm starting
import-export company.

1061
01:25:57.467 --> 01:25:58.592
Very exciting stuff.

1062
01:25:58.676 --> 01:26:02.304
I got a lot on my plate. You're lucky I'm here.

1063
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:15.817
Back in the old times, I might peel
your skin back. Fillet you.

1064
01:26:15.902 --> 01:26:18.653
"Fillet." It's a nice word.

1065
01:26:18.738 --> 01:26:23.450
I didn't know this before. Oh,
I had such a poor vocabulary.

1066
01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:30.640
But then I discovered this thing, Google.

1067
01:26:30.724 --> 01:26:34.769
Did you know the small and large
intestines is 20 foot long?

1068
01:26:34.853 --> 01:26:36.687
I had no idea. I don't believe it.

1069
01:26:36.772 --> 01:26:40.566
I gotta see this for myself. I'm dubious.
It's another nice word.

1070
01:26:40.651 --> 01:26:44.987
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too.

1071
01:26:45.072 --> 01:26:47.573
Don't worry, everything's sterilized.

1072
01:26:47.658 --> 01:26:50.701
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang.

1073
01:26:50.786 --> 01:26:52.953
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie.

1074
01:26:55.415 --> 01:26:57.291
What?

1075
01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:01.879
Ah!

1076
01:27:30.367 --> 01:27:32.535
Not much of a triumph, was it?

1077
01:27:32.619 --> 01:27:34.829
Because I would die here, too.

1078
01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:41.252
Only NZT could help me and the last
of it was in this fuck's bloodstream.

1079
01:28:56.953 --> 01:28:58.204
Victor!

1080
01:29:05.962 --> 01:29:07.588
What?

1081
01:29:15.222 --> 01:29:16.138
Ah!

1082
01:29:21.686 --> 01:29:22.895
Hey!

1083
01:29:24.898 --> 01:29:25.648
Ah!

1084
01:29:34.699 --> 01:29:36.534
Ah!

1085
01:30:16.992 --> 01:30:24.999
Victor?

1086
01:31:14.033 --> 01:31:15.533
The police would later note

1087
01:31:15.617 --> 01:31:18.244
that my apartment's previous
owner was an arms dealer.

1088
01:31:18.329 --> 01:31:23.499
Of course, these intruders had
been his dissatisfied clients.

1089
01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:26.210
And the night was still young.

1090
01:31:38.682 --> 01:31:40.808
I'm sure you're curious about
what happened to your boss.

1091
01:31:40.893 --> 01:31:43.019
I know I certainly am.

1092
01:31:43.103 --> 01:31:45.938
I mean, if my attorney was really
working for Mr. Atwood,

1093
01:31:46.023 --> 01:31:50.276
trying to save his life, why is he dead?

1094
01:31:50.361 --> 01:31:52.945
I mean, at what point was the pony
express supposed to ride in

1095
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:55.114
with his life-saving medication?

1096
01:31:56.158 --> 01:31:58.201
His boss was dead.

1097
01:31:58.285 --> 01:32:02.372
So, I didn't matter now.

1098
01:32:02.456 --> 01:32:07.168
But he did not appreciate that Morris
Brandt had kept the pills for himself.

1099
01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:21.474
And it was all still possible.

1100
01:32:39.952 --> 01:32:42.453
Actually, no, there's no more tickets.

1101
01:32:42.538 --> 01:32:46.999
Yeah, I know. An overbooked fundraiser. That's a first.

1102
01:32:47.084 --> 01:32:48.751
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.

1103
01:32:49.503 --> 01:32:50.920
Oh, that's much better.

1104
01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:53.548
- Greatjob.
- Thank you, sir.

1105
01:32:53.632 --> 01:32:54.757
Hi, Mr. Morra.

1106
01:32:54.842 --> 01:32:56.676
Edward!

1107
01:32:58.053 --> 01:33:00.304
I think we're looking at a second overflow event.

1108
01:33:00.389 --> 01:33:02.390
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think

1109
01:33:02.474 --> 01:33:04.767
they're even gonna try a second debate.

1110
01:33:04.852 --> 01:33:06.102
- Great.
- Hold on.

1111
01:33:06.186 --> 01:33:07.812
A guy from Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.

1112
01:33:07.896 --> 01:33:09.647
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.

1113
01:33:09.731 --> 01:33:10.940
Give him his two crappy little minutes.

1114
01:33:11.024 --> 01:33:13.401
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.

1115
01:33:15.279 --> 01:33:17.989
Finally get to meet the
guys that keep the lights on.

1116
01:33:19.491 --> 01:33:21.284
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.

1117
01:33:22.744 --> 01:33:26.247
What a surprise. They told me somebody
from Eiben was coming.

1118
01:33:26.331 --> 01:33:29.667
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm
moving out of the energy business.

1119
01:33:29.751 --> 01:33:33.463
Come on. That's like
Hef moving out of the mansion.

1120
01:33:33.547 --> 01:33:36.799
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months
ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.

1121
01:33:36.884 --> 01:33:40.928
No. No. Well, they really keep me hopping here.

1122
01:33:41.013 --> 01:33:43.806
Well, it's gonna pay off, Senator Morra.

1123
01:33:45.142 --> 01:33:47.518
The Senate. Who knows...

1124
01:33:47.603 --> 01:33:50.938
Everything's a technicality from
here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

1125
01:33:51.607 --> 01:33:56.194
I think we both know where it's
headed, if you can maintain.

1126
01:33:59.031 --> 01:34:02.241
Have you asked yourselfwhat you're
gonna do when you run out?

1127
01:34:17.925 --> 01:34:20.927
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.

1128
01:34:22.012 --> 01:34:25.431
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie. I
could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.

1129
01:34:25.516 --> 01:34:26.933
We could have been partners.

1130
01:34:30.687 --> 01:34:32.522
So, Eiben makes NZT.

1131
01:34:32.606 --> 01:34:35.399
Well, it'll never officially exist.

1132
01:34:35.484 --> 01:34:38.027
Obviously, I don't need to point
out the advantages for you.

1133
01:34:38.946 --> 01:34:40.446
Oh, I think maybe you do.

1134
01:34:40.531 --> 01:34:44.450
Limitless supply. We know you can't get any more.

1135
01:34:44.535 --> 01:34:46.035
You sure about that?

1136
01:34:46.119 --> 01:34:47.954
They shut down your lab this morning.

1137
01:34:50.457 --> 01:34:54.001
Eddie. I just want to help you, that's all.

1138
01:34:54.086 --> 01:34:57.046
Keep you supplied. No disruption in service.

1139
01:34:57.130 --> 01:34:59.215
Give you peace of mind. That's all.

1140
01:35:00.884 --> 01:35:03.886
And in return, I do what?

1141
01:35:03.971 --> 01:35:07.765
Get a little advice, maybe. I won't
be bothering you much at first.

1142
01:35:07.849 --> 01:35:10.309
And later. What are you gonna be bothering me with?

1143
01:35:10.394 --> 01:35:14.063
Well, given where you're heading, some
of our ideas are a bit ambitious.

1144
01:35:14.147 --> 01:35:16.023
But hey, I think they're achievable.

1145
01:35:16.108 --> 01:35:17.858
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1146
01:35:17.943 --> 01:35:20.319
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."

1147
01:35:20.404 --> 01:35:23.906
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light.

1148
01:35:25.784 --> 01:35:27.243
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even

1149
01:35:27.327 --> 01:35:28.327
go there right now.

1150
01:35:28.412 --> 01:35:31.706
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...

1151
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:35.501
...and healthy. Come on. Let's go get some lunch.

1152
01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:55.730
After you, Senator.

1153
01:35:57.274 --> 01:35:59.191
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.

1154
01:36:00.068 --> 01:36:01.819
Give us a second.

1155
01:36:01.903 --> 01:36:04.614
What are you doing? Do you want to
be President of the United States

1156
01:36:04.698 --> 01:36:07.366
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.

1157
01:36:07.451 --> 01:36:10.661
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.

1158
01:36:10.746 --> 01:36:11.954
You don't think some smartass on NZT

1159
01:36:12.039 --> 01:36:13.623
might have two or three or even four labs?

1160
01:36:13.707 --> 01:36:15.875
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.

1161
01:36:15.959 --> 01:36:18.002
I thought better of it. See, once you know what's in it,

1162
01:36:18.086 --> 01:36:21.714
you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.

1163
01:36:22.424 --> 01:36:23.758
I'm off it, Carl.

1164
01:36:23.842 --> 01:36:25.092
Well, on it or off it,

1165
01:36:25.177 --> 01:36:27.470
there's no scenario where you're not working for me.

1166
01:36:27.554 --> 01:36:29.055
How you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?

1167
01:36:29.139 --> 01:36:30.306
Last year you traded

1168
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:32.308
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?

1169
01:36:32.392 --> 01:36:35.478
Blank checks from Dubai. Dumping
in Chile. Disappeared officials.

1170
01:36:35.562 --> 01:36:37.647
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?

1171
01:36:37.731 --> 01:36:39.815
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.

1172
01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.859
There's no way you can be making
accusations like that

1173
01:36:41.943 --> 01:36:44.278
and be walking around alive.

1174
01:36:44.363 --> 01:36:46.947
That you would even think that shows me
how unprepared you are to fight me.

1175
01:36:47.032 --> 01:36:48.574
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it,

1176
01:36:48.659 --> 01:36:51.035
but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?

1177
01:36:51.119 --> 01:36:52.453
That I kept absolutely nothing?

1178
01:36:52.537 --> 01:36:54.121
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be.

1179
01:36:54.206 --> 01:36:57.041
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?

1180
01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.794
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.

1181
01:36:59.878 --> 01:37:01.671
He has 60 feet to stop. He doesn't have room.

1182
01:37:01.755 --> 01:37:03.506
What van?

1183
01:37:06.843 --> 01:37:08.219
I see everything, Carl.

1184
01:37:08.303 --> 01:37:10.596
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else.

1185
01:37:10.681 --> 01:37:13.015
What makes you think I don't have a
guy with a bead on you right now?

1186
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.809
How do you know you're gonna
be alive this time next year?

1187
01:37:14.893 --> 01:37:18.020
What are you doing? You get your hands
off me. What are you doing?

1188
01:37:18.105 --> 01:37:20.856
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.

1189
01:37:20.941 --> 01:37:24.151
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're
gonna need to get that replaced.

1190
01:37:25.946 --> 01:37:27.571
But you already knew that.

1191
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.204
You know, you should really be glad about this.

1192
01:37:35.288 --> 01:37:38.332
'Cause me working for you? You'd end up as my bitch.

1193
01:37:50.303 --> 01:37:53.055
Maybe we should cool off. Talk again.

1194
01:37:54.891 --> 01:37:56.767
I don't think so.

1195
01:37:58.353 --> 01:37:59.603
Don't forget to vote.

1196
01:38:07.904 --> 01:38:09.321
Edward.

1197
01:38:09.406 --> 01:38:11.031
You good?

1198
01:38:11.116 --> 01:38:14.076
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.

1199
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.376
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.

1200
01:38:24.463 --> 01:38:27.006
- How's your day going?
- Ah. I've had better.

1201
01:38:28.842 --> 01:38:30.843
I still can't deal with that haircut.

1202
01:38:30.927 --> 01:38:33.012
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street.

1203
01:38:33.096 --> 01:38:34.847
Well, I'm a new man.

1204
01:38:36.183 --> 01:38:37.183
I've already ordered.

1205
01:38:52.316 --> 01:38:53.900
What?

1206
01:38:54.305 --> 01:39:00.534
